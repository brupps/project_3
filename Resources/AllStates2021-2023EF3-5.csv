The tornado began along Chapel Hills Parkway, where minor shingle damage occurred. The tornado tracked northeastward across Ellard Road and directly over the Walker Chapel Road overpass on Interstate 65. It was at this interstate exit where the tornado began to intensify rapidly, snapping numerous power poles and causing substantial damage to a hotel. The tornado continued northeastward, crossing Highway 31, causing mostly tree damage along the highway. As the tornado moved into residential areas along Fulton Drive and Lykes Boulevard, substantial damage occurred with several homes being destroyed with at least one being swept off the foundation. There was also significant tree damage in the neighborhood. Several homes along Georgetown Lane suffered significant damage as wind breached garage doors, aiding in complete roof loss in some cases. Other damage included destroyed fences, sheds, and lofting of a hot tub. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped.||As the tornado continued toward the northeast, it paralleled Carson Road and caused substantial damage to homes along Meida Circle, Darlene Drive, and New Castle Road. Buildings in an industrial area along Carson Road were damaged, including a fleet of vehicles at Hurst Towing. The damage along New Castle Road was widespread with a few trees debarked or snapped half way down the trunk, and debris from homes thrown considerable distances. The tornado began to weaken somewhat after crossing North Pine Hill Road, but still caused minor damage to the Fultondale High School and a wooded area to the east.  As it continued eastward crossing Indian Valley Road, several trees were uprooted and a few homes received minor damage.  Along Highway 79, dozens of mobile homes were damaged by falling trees in the Rusk Mobile Home Park. The tornado then crossed Highway 75 in Center Point, where trees and power lines were downed near the Jefferson County Multi-Services Facility. The tornado began to weaken further at this point, but still produced a narrow discernable track of EF0 damage just east of Center Point Lake, where trees were uprooted and minor roof and structural damage occurred. Nearing the end of its life cycle, the tornado turned northward before dissipating near Country View Court in the Arrowhead subdivision of Center Point.","A unusually warm and humid airmass was present across Central Alabama the night of January 25th due to persistent and deep south to southwest low level flow.  Surface  dew points were in the low to mid 60s and surface-based instability reached 1000-1200 J/kg. Strong shear over a deep layer was also in place and combined with the instability, favored a risk for severe storms.||The storm that produced the tornado over Jefferson County developed over Central Mississippi. As the storm moved across Mississippi and into West Alabama, it exhibited episodes of mid level rotation, but not strong enough to produce a tornado. As the storm entered Jefferson County, its structure underwent organization. A rotational signature quickly matured, with an associated BWER signature on KBMX radar. A strong tornado formed just north of the city of Birmingham.",1

Significant tree damage occurred near Verdin Lane with trees uprooted, trunks snapped and large tree limbs broken and tossed into homes.  Damage to homes in this area appeared to be primarily due to falling trees.  Tree damage continued through Killdeer Drive and along Bailey Road.  Damage to roofs occurred to some homes in this area.  Several utility poles were blown down on Bailey Road, between Lighthouse Drive and Coach Drive.  Windows were broken and debris was embedded in stucco on a southside wall of an apartment building on the southeast corner of Bailey Road and Coach Drive.  The tornado gradually intensified east of Naper Boulevard.  Large trees were snapped just east of Naper Boulevard along Bailey Road.  One fell onto a home causing roof damage.  Naperville Fire Station #2 was damaged.||The tornado jogged to the northeast and began to increase in width with tree damage continuing through Fender Road, where roof and wall damage occurred to a home from a falling tree.  Tree damage continued through Clemson Drive and Wehrli Road.  Widespread tree damage occurred near 77th Street where one car was flipped over and a second car was damaged by debris.  Roof and siding damage occurred to homes and a garage wall was removed.  A garage door was blown in and a wall was destroyed on Siebert Court.  The tornado destroyed a home on Princeton Circle.  The house completely collapsed with debris deposited to the northeast, though homes on either side remained standing with only minor damage.  It is at this location that the tornado reached peak intensity of EF3.  In the same block, considerable damage occurred to roofs of several nearby homes.  Damage to homes continued along Nutmeg Lane to Shady Grove Court, including the removal of walls on the second floor of at least one home and roofing damage to several others.  The tornado increased in width as it moved between 75th and 79th Streets, destroying garages and lifting roofing of an apartment complex along Gladstone Drive.  Considerable tree damage also occurred in the Green Valley Forest Preserve as the tornado crossed Greene Road.||The tornado continued east across Route 53 with tree and roof damage noted.  More significant damage began again near Woodridge Drive.  Several homes were damaged with large trees uprooted or snapped.  Multiple fences were also blown down.  Damage to homes continued near Evergreen Lane and James Court where several homes suffered significant roof and second story damage.  The tornado crossed Interstate 355 where a large portion of a traffic sign on southbound Interstate 355 was ripped off two steel posts.  The missing section of the traffic sign was found in a pond in the Lake Ridge Club, between 79th Street and 81st Street, east of Madison Street in Burr Ridge, nearly 6 miles from its original location.||Significant damage occurred to homes and apartment buildings east of Interstate 355 between Country Club Drive and Egerton Drive.  Some roofs were completely removed.  Tree and roof damage continued along Pine Drive and Britten Street.  The tornado began to increase in width again as it crossed Lemont Road where a warehouse building was damaged.  Tree and roof damage continued through Highland Avenue, Plainfield Road, Bailey Road and Cass Avenue.  At least one apartment building suffered significant roof damage along Lakeview Drive.  East of Cass Avenue, the tornado produced mainly tree damage, crossing Interstate 55, then Route 83 and then moving east along 83rd Street.  Damage occurred to several dozen homes in Burr Ridge.  The tornado crossed into Cook County near 83rd Street.||In Naperville, 231 structures reported some level of damage.  One home was completely destroyed, 19 were declared uninhabitable and 143 sustained major damage.  In Woodridge, 640 structures were damaged, including 31 homes that were uninhabitable and 157 that sustained major damage.  In Darrien, 2 homes were damaged and 1 was uninhabitable.  In Burr Ridge, 50 homes were damaged.  A total of 11 people were injured, including a woman who was 6 months pregnant and was critically injured.  She lost her unborn baby as the result of her injuries.",A line of severe thunderstorms moved across northern Illinois during the late evening of June 20th and the early morning of June 21st producing wind damage and three tornadoes.,12

It developed west southwest of Lake City and produced tree and power line damage.  The tornado moved into and across the southern portion of Lake City.  Imagery from UAV's and chasers show that the tornado was multi-vortex as it passed through the city.  Up to EF2 damage occurred as it passed through town.  As the tornado moved east of the town, it began to consolidate into a larger funnel and strengthen.  It passed through a farmstead producing considerable damage to the farmhouse and out buildings with EF3 damage noted on the house.  The tornado continued for a few more miles and impacted a confinement facility before lifting to the northwest of Lohrville.  Fortunately, no injuries or deaths occurred with this tornado.","A surface low pressure system was centered over Kansas and Nebraska with attendant warm front draped across north central Iowa. This was bisected by an outflow boundary from morning convection across western Iowa.

Near the remnant outflow boundary 0-1 km SRH exceeded 150 m2/s2. Storms developed along this boundary and moved east along the warm front, spawning a number of tornadoes across the state. In fact, this is in the top 5 for tornadoes occurring in a single day for the state of Iowa since reliable records began in the 1980s. By evening convection congealed into an MCS, bringing heavy rain to portions of the state. A line of training storms set up north of the Des Moines metro, resulting in localized flash flooding.",14

The tornado then moved into Bucks County, with trees uprooted at the county line.","A strong shortwave trough moved east-southeastward out of the Great Lakes region on July 29. An associated, strengthening surface low also tracked out of the Great Lakes and into upstate New York. A warm front associated with this low moved through most of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This front, combined with the remains of widespread convection to the west from the previous overnight and morning hours, brought significant cloud cover to the eastern mid-Atlantic for much of the day on the 29th. This was mainly in the form of mid and high level cloud cover, however, and temperatures still warmed to near seasonal levels behind the warm front, allowing moderate to strong instability to build. Meanwhile, the robust surface and upper level disturbances approaching the region brought both strong forcing and unseasonably strong wind shear. By mid-afternoon, an unusually favorable convective environment existed over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.||The result of this environment was a rare tornado outbreak across the area. Initially, during the mid-afternoon hours, mixed convective modes over east-central Pennsylvania produced a couple instances of damaging wind and brief tornadoes as storms attempted to overcome cloud cover and some light stratiform rain in the area. With time, as storms moved into better instability and a less contaminated environment over far eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, they took on more supercellular structures. Multiple cyclic supercells would go on to produce several tornadoes, three of them strong (EF2+) over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Convection persisted past the sunset hour with little to no loss in intensity due to the strong forcing. The only thing that put an end to the outbreak was the coastline, as storms moved offshore towards 9 to 10PM local time. Even offshore, one supercell continued to exhibit strong rotation and likely produced a strong waterspout for tens of miles over the Atlantic.||Fortunately, and miraculously, no serious injuries or loss of life occurred as a result of this outbreak. With the passage of a cold front late on the evening of the 29th, cooler, drier, and much less active weather would grace the region for several days as clean-up efforts began.",15

As it moved northward, Ida began transitioning to a strong mid-latitude cyclone with pronounced frontal features, but with continued tropical moisture. On a regional level, the remnants of Ida became one of the most severe natural disasters in US history, due to a combination of several tornadoes, some of them strong, as well as catastrophic flooding over a large and densely populated area. The severe weather threat unfolded as the system's developing warm front lifted northward from the Delmarva region into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. South of the warm front, partial clearing and moderate to strong instability developed. Meanwhile, very strong shear and forcing, along with tropical moisture, were present within the warm sector. The result was widespread convection in the form of both supercell and quasi-linear thunderstorms.

The tornado continued to the northeast along the river and began impacting homes as it approached Fredericktown. Here the tornado ripped half of the roof off of one home, rolled a manufactured home onto its side, pulled roofing material from another home, and continued to cause considerable tree damage. The tornado widened to about 1/2 mile as it approached MO Highway 72 from the southwest, damaging multiple homes and businesses. A business on the south side of Highway 72 is where the only known injury took place, where an individual was hurt climbing out of the debris after the tornado had exited the area. The tornado strengthened as it moved north of Highway 72, completely destroying a number of homes. It was determined that the frames of these homes were largely only toe-nailed into their foundation, which precluded a higher rating than a low-end EF-3. The tornado then impacted the Black River Electric Co-op. Here the tornado ripped a well-built canopy from between two small warehouses, completely destroyed one of these small warehouses, and then completely destroyed a larger steel warehouse attached to the main office. The steel warehouse was very well constructed, with steel I-beams approximately 1 foot in width, bolted into the concrete foundation roughly every 20 feet. These beams spanned the roof of the structure and supported a thick, crimped sheet metal exterior. This is believed to be where the tornado reached peak intensity, with approximately 150 mph winds. The attached office fared notably better, sustaining mainly roof damage and the loss of several windows. The office was very well constructed, consisting of brick and concrete walls. The tornado then crossed US highway 67 and continued to cause considerable damage. Two newly built self-storage buildings with north facing bay doors were completely destroyed, while a third identical building with south facing doors was damaged, but remained standing. Two more homes were also impacted in this area. The roof was completely ripped from one of these homes, though most of the walls, which were bolted into the concrete foundation, were left standing. Only a few interior walls remained on the second home, though it appeared that the frame of this home was only toe-nailed into the foundation. The poor construction of the second home, and the lack of hurricane clips on the roof of the first, precluded a higher rating than EF-2 in this area. As the tornado continued northeast, it moved through additional residential areas, damaging several more homes and businesses. The tornado may have begun to weaken somewhat at this point, as the walls largely remained standing on most of these buildings. The tornado then began to move into more rural areas to the northeast of Fredericktown, where it caused consistent tree damage for several more miles, ripped most of the roof from one home, and completely destroyed a barn. The tornado may have briefly lifted as it moved into northeastern Madison County before coming back down and causing considerable tree damage along Madison county road 252. Along the Madison/Perry county line, where it moved into WFO Paducah's County Warning Area, the width was about 1/2 of a mile wide with numerous trees snapped and uprooted. The portion of the tornado path in Madison County was rated EF3 overall with a path length of 14.83 miles and a max path width of 880 yards. There was one injury and no deaths in Madison County.

The tornado was about 1.3 miles wide when it entered the county. It varied from 1 to 1.3 miles in width as it traversed Graves County. The primary impact to Graves County was on the city of Mayfield, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This city suffered a devastating impact, in terms of both loss of life and property destruction. There were 23 fatalities countywide and many more injuries. On the southwest edge of Mayfield as the tornado entered the city, a candle factory was demolished (DI 23, DOD 7). At least nine workers in the factory were killed. The tornado continued northeast through the heart of Mayfield at 9:28 PM CST, averaging just over one mile in width. The downtown area was directly impacted, crippling the police and fire department headquarters and emergency communications. Residential neighborhoods both southwest and northeast of downtown were destroyed. Numerous businesses in the downtown business district collapsed. Several damage sites in the city of Mayfield received a wind speed estimate of 188 mph, the highest in the county. Many of the structures were historic brick buildings (DI 17, DOD 7). At least 1,500 structures were damaged or destroyed, including a couple hundred businesses. The Red Cross estimated that 730 dwellings were uninhabitable. A large number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment in rural areas outside the city. Nearly total tree destruction was observed. The first EF-4 damage in the county was noted at and around the candle factory on the southwest side of Mayfield. Near the candle factory, a house was swept clean off the concrete slab (DI 2, DOD 10). The last EF-4 damage points in the county were on the northeast side of Mayfield, including a nursing home (DI 7, DOD 7). After entering Graves County, the tornado intersected I-69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) four miles southwest of the Mayfield city limit. A wind gust to 93 knots or 107 mph was measured at the University of Kentucky mesonet site 6 miles southwest of Mayfield. The tornado then closely followed Interstate 69 northeast all the way to Marshall County. The tornado crossed the interstate multiple times. The first crossing was two miles southwest of Mayfield, then again northeast of Mayfield just east of the Highway 131 interchange, and again at the Marshall County line. The interstate was blocked in spots by trees, power lines, and debris. From Highway 131 to Highway 301 northeast of Mayfield, the tornado followed the exact same path as the May 10, 2016 EF-3 tornado. Some of the same structures that were damaged in that tornado were destroyed by this tornado. The tornado exited Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) where it crosses the county line.","On the evening of Friday, December 10, 2021, a potent storm system moving across the central United States resulted in significant long-track tornadoes. A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.",30

This tornado crossed from Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 about seven miles west-southwest of Benton. The tornado  widened to nearly 1.5 miles (2450 yards) soon after crossing into Marshall County. The tornado width fluctuated from 0.8 mile to nearly 1.5 miles during its trek across the county. The community most impacted was Cambridge Shores, a rather dense subdivision of vacation homes and some luxury homes on Kentucky Lake. This is the only location in Marshall County where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatalities in Marshall County. A 78-year-old female resident died in the hallway of her house. Another elderly woman died of a heart attack while trying to remove debris (indirect). There were numerous homes in Cambridge Shores that were levelled, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). Some homes were wiped off the foundation. Marshall County's highest wind speed estimate of 170 mph was assigned to the damage in the Cambridge Shores area. A total of 356 structures in Marshall County were destroyed or uninhabitable. Another 341 structures sustained light to moderate damage. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some that landed in Kentucky Lake. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cambridge Shores area. After crossing into Marshall County, the tornado path stayed over Interstate 69 from the county line to about three miles west of Benton. In this area a few miles west of Benton, a home was blown off its foundation and a few other homes were demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). The tornado narrowly missed the county seat of Benton, passing only a mile or two northwest of the downtown area. Where the tornado crossed U.S. 641 just north of Benton, a home was destroyed with the exception of some interior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 68 about one mile southeast of the county high school, then continued on to Cambridge Shores.

The tornado produced catastrophic damage and some fatalities in Dawson Springs. About two-thirds of the city's homes were destroyed, and about a dozen fatalities occurred. There were at least 200 injuries. The core of the tornado narrowly missed the downtown Dawson Springs business district, but a large residential neighborhood on the north side of downtown was destroyed. This neighborhood is where the tornado obtained its maximum EF-4 rating in Hopkins County. A two-story apartment building was almost totally destroyed. Only a few first-story interior walls remained standing (DI 5, DOD 6). This apartment building is where the damage was assigned a wind speed estimate of 180 mph, the highest in the county. On the northern edge of town, over a dozen duplexes suffered complete roof loss. All exterior and interior walls of one of the units collapsed (DI 2, DOD 9). Most of the single-family homes suffered complete roof loss and the loss of most exterior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). In a few cases, there was complete destruction of residences (DI 2, DOD 10). On Highway 109 on the northeast side of town, a large retail structure with a long-span roof was destroyed (DI 12, DOD 7).

The tornado retained EF-1 strength through an abandoned coal strip mine, snapping hardwood trees, overturning a large section of coal conveyor belt, and downing steel and wood power poles. Rugged terrain seems to have affected the tornado at times as it fluctuated in width and intensity moving across A9 Road, to Matanzas Road, and approaching A5 road. It weakened to around the EF-0/EF-1 threshold and narrowed to 200-300 yards as it crossed A5 Road and A6 Lane, before rapidly intensifying to EF-2 strength over Chandle Loop and Highway 85. Here, a large chicken farm lost 5 out of 7 of its well built chicken houses. The foundations were swept clean. In addition, several homes and barns suffered major damage or total destruction. Hundreds of large hardwoods were snapped and uprooted. One well built house had a large portion of roof removed along with partial wall collapse. Max width in this area was around a quarter mile. The tornado maintained solid EF-1 strength and narrowed to a width around 300 yards as it briefly paralleled Carter Ferry Road, and then approached and crossed A7 Road. From here, a significant topography change occurred as the tornado crossed the Rough River and entered much flatter open farmland. Damage was noted to a grove of snapped hardwood trees near Johnson School and Mud College Roads. Then, several (6 or 7) large steel electrical transmission lines were either broken or bent across a widening half to almost three quarter mile wide width. The tornado had gained significant intensity up to EF-2/EF-3 strength as it slammed into homes and businesses along US 231 only about 1 to 1.5 miles NW of Hartford. On the west side of US 231, two semi tractor trailers were lifted, twisted, and thrown 40 yards from their original position, badly mangling one of the cabs. In addition, a barn was completely demolished. A small, brick office structure was totally destroyed only leaving one half of a wall and a few interior rooms, while completely wiping away the other half of the building. Winds peaked at an estimated 140 mph here. Across the highway a well built, and nearly 100 year old, brick two story home lost its entire roof and collapsed a couple of upstairs walls. Other homes, very large silos, small businesses, and a fertilizer storage facility were heavily damaged in addition to some very large and healthy hardwood trees being snapped, twisted, and snarled. The tornado maintained EF-2/EF-3 intensity as it continued northeastward, crossing the William H Natcher Parkway and approaching Highway 69. Here, more intense damage occurred along 69 between Utley Road and along Morrison Run. At Utley Road, 2 homes and 1 double wide trailer were completely destroyed, and a 4th brick home lost an entire roof and collapsed a couple of walls. Here, an amazing survival story occurred as the residents of the 3 structures that were completely destroyed hunkered in the bathroom of the brick home and rode out the intense tornado. Luckily, no injuries occurred thanks to the great decisions made by the occupants to find a sturdier structure to ride out the storm. A large barn was also heavily damaged here. The next set of homes downstream from Utley Road experienced very intense damage. Here, two anchored mobile homes were completely destroyed as their frames were tossed and bent. One frame ended up 100 yards from its original position. A fifth wheel camper was thrown and landed upside down 30 yards from where it sat. A small farmhouse was also heavily damaged as some walls completely collapsed. Another survival story occurred here as residents made a decision to leave the area to seek better shelter. Many compliments were given to local television media coverage and warning lead time. Two more homes were either heavily damaged or destroyed as the tornado crossed Highway 69. A well built two story home lost half of its upper story, and a small brick home was sheared in half. Damage was observed by NWS surveyors to several hardwood trees along Morrison Run from Cedar Grove Road. However, the most intense tree damage of the Ohio County path occurred along Humble Valley Road where some local terrain influences very likely funneled the tornadic winds into a consolidated area. Here, strong EF-2 to near EF-3 winds snapped thousands of hardwood trees and damaged a few homes, barns, and sheds. It took 2 to 3 days to clear Humble Valley Road for access. A barn was destroyed, along with tree damage, and complete destruction of a home under construction along W Halls Creek Road. As the tornado continued toward the intersection of highways 878 and 919, it crossed Bean Hill doing mainly tree damage. It then did major tree damage, unroofed a home, and destroyed a barn at that intersection. Heavy damage occurred at New Baymus Road where a farm lost three substantial barns, and a deer farm was heavily damaged along with a bunch of equipment. Clinton Lane was the next to be hit as a brand new barn, power poles, and a few structures were damaged or destroyed. The barn was totally destroyed and thrown hundreds of yards downstream, and hundreds of hardwood trees were snapped. One cow was killed by flying debris here. Downwind of that, a trailer was cut in half amongst very heavy tree damage, and the occupants of the mangled half of the trailer had fled to a safer shelter. Hundreds of hardwoods were snapped around Cane Ford Lane along with total destruction of an old trailer. From there, the tornado climbed a ridge and crossed Highway 54, heavily damaging a home and garage, along with continuing to mangle hundreds of hardwood and softwood trees.",Strong southern winds brought warm temperatures and plenty of moisture into an environment of strong wind shear ahead of an advancing cold front. This resulted in unusually warm temperatures for a December day and the ingredients to produce a historic tornado outbreak and flash flooding. This included multiple long track tornadoes. Central Kentucky saw 18 tornadoes that injured 96 and killed 18. An additional death occurred in a flash flood.,38

The tornado damaged or destroyed several homes near Cottage Grove. The tornado continued northeast toward Buchanan mostly uprooting and snapping trees. A few homes and mobile homes were damaged near Buchanan. As the tornado approached Kentucky Lake several mobile homes were significantly damaged. The tornado then crossed into Calloway County, Kentucky. Peak winds in Henry County were estimated at 150 mph.","December 10, 2021, was unseasonably warm over the region. Temperatures broke several long-standing records. Memphis hit 80��F which broke a 103-year-old high-temperature record. ||A strong upper-level trough was approaching from the west, providing strong lift within the unseasonably warm and unstable air mass.  MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.  Along with tornadoes, several incidents of wind damage and minor flash flooding also occurred.",39

The tornado continued approximately 6 miles into Warren County before dissipating at 0114 CST. In Logan County, the supercell that had cycled down its tornado in eastern Todd County (but continued to produce wind damage northeast of Elkton) spun back up again soon after crossing the border into western Logan County. It quickly ramped up to EF-3 (140 mph) intensity with a damage swath roughly three quarters of a mile wide along Milton Sharp Rd. On the southern side, a family was home when a 2 by 4 narrowly missed the husband as the roof was being peeled off the middle of the house. On the north side, a large dairy farm was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued northeast, a wide swath of trees was snapped/uprooted along the edge of a forest on the southern edge of the vortex, while on the north edge a well built home had its second floor two-thirds thrown off. A male was in the other section when a 2 by 4 from the first floor came up and got lodged in his mattress. Another well built log cabin in this area lost its second floor roof. The tornado then turned more ENE in the Buena Vista Rd area. A doublewide manufactured home was completely destroyed here along with several outbuildings on the property. A male at the home received warning from family and heard the tornado approach, getting into a bath tub in the middle of the east side of the structure. After it hit, the home blew into a row of trees and the male remembers grabbing onto a tree southeast of his original location. He sustained injuries as medics had to get wood out of his legs. The tornado continued over to Lakewood Ln where a boy was in the second story of a house when the window imploded inward and moved the bed he was in. After this, the storm crossed US 431, impacting several trees along Hwy 1040 with EF1 level winds. It then moved to a row of mobile homes along H.C. Johnson Rd. Two of these homes were completely destroyed, with one blown into a row of trees south of its original point and another lifted up and over a tree just east of its original location. This may have been a mesovortex spinning around the main circulation. The tornado damage was widest at this location, roughly 0.8 mile. On the south side of the tornado, a mobile home was completely destroyed along Hwy 915 where it was spread out over the road. The resident was a female whose father insisted she stay the night at his place, with a basement, after hearing the messaging in the days before. That same mesovortex may have been what caused the collapse of an electric transmission line just east of Marshall Rd where there was little damage to surrounding trees. Farther north on that road a well built brick home had its roof taken off as well as the carport removed. The tornado continued to track along Hwy 79 towards the Chandlers Chapel area where the Methodist Church lost its steeple and had damage to several of the stained glass windows. A couple of homes had major damage here. A resident said he had at least 20 minutes of warning lead time ahead of the touchdown. There was additional damage along Turner Road and then 3 Poplars Rd. This survey ended soon after 3 Poplars Rd. Another survey was conducted in the far northeast corner of Logan County where a couple of long chicken barns were leveled.",Strong southern winds brought warm temperatures and plenty of moisture into an environment of strong wind shear ahead of an advancing cold front.

The tornado first touched down in rural southwestern Warren County just south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Rd. It tracked to the northeast for approximately 26 miles before entering Edmonson County. The tornado continued approximately 3.6 miles into Edmonson before dissipating at 0138 CST. At the tornado's beginning in Warren County, the tornado twisted, snapped, topped and uprooted softwood and hardwood trees. The tornado was about 200 yards wide, with EF1 winds of 90 mph. Aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged area of southwest Warren County. The tornado increased to EF2, between 120 and 125 mph, doing major damage to several older barns along Tommy Smith Road. It threw a 1700 pound cattle trailer, 300 yards into a creek ravine.The NWS drone showed a distinct narrow main funnel within the larger funnel. This 30 to 35 yard funnel was clearly seen scouring the corn field and produced the most concentrated damage. The narrow funnel crossed Browning Rd and hit a well constructed house. The only major part of the house that survived was an interior bathroom and hallway. Winds were estimated at 135 mph, and areas outside the narrow funnel had damage of 100 mph, and the entire overall width was 250 yards wide. The survey team found extensive tree damage along Van Meter Rd and Fuqua Rd and aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged, mainly forested area. The tornado did minor roof damage to some homes along Blue Level Road with winds of 86 to 90 mph but did more substantial roof and side damage to several barns with winds of 90 to 95 mph. Based on drone technology, there appeared to be two distinct areas of damage, and likely had a smaller satellite tornado. There was extensive roof damage to the Zomi Agape fellowship center with insulation thrown both downwind and on the upwind side of the building. The tornado increased in speed when it was over Old Tramm Rd by Rembrandt Court and Powell Road. One house on Rembrandt Court was knocked off its foundation by the garage attachment and slid about 15 feet. Other homes were knocked down to just interior bathrooms and hallways remaining, but there were some foundation construction concerns. EF2 winds of 130 to 135 mph were evidenced in this area. Several houses were knocked down to the foundation, but there were foundation construction concerns. In addition, farm equipment from a barn on the right side of Powell St was thrown directly into homes on the left side of Powell Rd. The survey team found significant house damage to dozens of homes in the Creekwood subdivision. This included exterior collapsed walls, roofs blown off, foundations severely compromised, garages blown in, insulation blown on all four sides of houses, and garages severely damaged or destroyed. In fact, they were dozens of double garages damaged, where one garage door blew in and the other garage door blew out. There were hundreds of powerlines and snapped power poles down throughout the county. Trees were uprooted snapped and twisted facing in all directions. Dozens of cars were flipped, twisted, turned, and thrown into homes. 2 x 4s were thrown into the ground, like missiles. Several splintered boards were impaled into vehicle windshields, tires, and along the hood grills. Most of the damage was rated EF2 from 115 to 135 mph except for 8 homes near Mossy Creek. The survey team brought in engineers from WKU to look at 8 homes, which were wiped down to the foundation from Moss Creek to Mossy Stone. Engineers helped in determining winds speeds were 160 mph for these houses, a high EF3 rating. Tragically, several fatalities occurred in the subdivision area. The tornado was 250 yards wide in Creekwood, but increased to about 350 yards wide before crossing Veterans Parkway. The tornado crossed the William Natcher Parkway and hit large townhouses along Veterans Parkway. There were numerous windows shattered and some roof damage. One of the town houses was shifted off the foundation, but there were no bricks or other support on it. The tornado crossed Russellville Rd hitting many businesses. At Royal Motor Cars, several storage buildings were destroyed, major loss of roof panels at Cabreras Mexican restaurant and an auto parts store. At Plumbers Supply company at 2321 Russellville Rd. The garage was blown in and collapsed. The main building had a shifted foundation, and a partial collapse of some exterior cinderblock walls, tractors and trailers were twisted and flipped, and there was numerous power poles snapped. The Shell gas station had major damage to service station canopy and store, as well as walls of an Enterprise car rental. The tornado increased to quarter mile wide and went from EF2 of 130 mph, from Royal Motorcars to AutoZone, and then decreased to EF2, 115-120 mph and narrowed to 1/8th of a mile with major tree and roof damage along Lealand Street, Cedar Ridge, and University Drive. A fully loaded dumpster was thrown 250 yards. At Russell Road and Springhill Avenue, a Marathon gas station had its pumps destroyed, and most of the exterior walls were destroyed. The tornado missed Western Kentucky University by 225 yards, but debris was thrown all over the campus including some impaled debris into buildings. The tornado went along 31W including doing significant damage to roof at Bobas lounge, a liquor store, and a smoke shop. This was estimated to be 110 to 120 mph winds, and tornado width decreased to 250 yards by Walgreens and Taco Bell. The tornado, appeared to be slightly elevated, doing mainly tree damage, power poles, and house roofing and siding along Magnolia Ave and Nutwood St. It crossed Lehman, went along Covington, with wind speeds mainly of 95 to 110 mph. The owner of 708 Nutwood said, your warning saved our lives, as our house was violently shaking, but we sought shelter and lived. Much of the tree damage was facing from the northeast to the northwest. The tornado paralleled Cemetery Rd doing roof and gutter damage along with power lines and tree damage. The tornadoes speed and winds increased along Cherokee Dr. with roofs removed and large healthy hardwood trees uprooted. The width increased to 300 yards and speeds to 105 mph with width of 225 yards. The narrow 175 yard funnel, hit the Indian Hills golf course, twisting, snapping, and topping numerous pines and cedars with winds speeds of 86 to 90 mph. The tornado then crossed the Barren River and increased in speed along Old Porter Pike to EF2, between 111 and 120 mph. Huge diameter hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, including several very tall oak trees. There was also extensive roof damage to some well built homes. It weakened as it approached exit 28, doing EF1 damage of 90-95 mph to Hucks gas station and damaged a very tall Wendys sign. On the north side of 31 W, a fully loaded 18 wheeler facing west, was knocked over and was dragged 15 yards to a northwesterly directly. Winds were increased to EF2, of 115 mph. At the Corvette plant there was significant roof damage, with metal sheeting, insulation, HVAC units, and other debris thrown hundreds of yards downwind. Light poles in the parking lot were snapped, One of the security checkpoints at the Corvette plant was totally destroyed with large sections of the building being thrown several hundred yards, and weighing over 100 pounds, striking several vehicles. Winds were mainly in the 110 to 120 mph range. The tornado continued to parallel I 65, just west of the interstate. It struck several homes at Bristow Rd and Friendship Rd. Most of the damage was done to roofs siding and gutters and destroyed a well- built greenhouse. Numerous power poles and lines were down and the debris pattern was facing from southeasterly, all the way to northwesterly. There was some barn and tree damage near Kelly Road and the CSX railroad crossing. Winds were 85 to 90 mph and width of 200 yards. The tornado really increased across the TransPark at Exit 30. A few metal building structures at the peak intensity of the tornado sustained heavy damage. The middle building totally collapsed. Analysis showed that building was well constructed, but the shearing force from the intense tornado ripped the metal frame from the anchoring plates of the building. Analysis of the third building showed the tornado had weakened some at this point, down to EF2 levels. The WSR-8D radar showed a Tornadic Debris Signature downstream of this area, which was lofted to around 18 kft, right at the high end of EF3 of 165 mph. The tornado weakened further downstream as it caused roofing and siding damage to several structures and tree damage into southeast Edmonson County. Civil Air Patrol imagery helped identify the end point of this tornado.",Strong southern winds brought warm temperatures and plenty of moisture into an environment of strong wind shear ahead of an advancing cold front.

The tornado continued off to the northeast and intensified as it moved toward Quisenberry Road. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed along Quisenberry Road, and this is where a fatality occurred. Aerial drone views showed extensive damage with path widths 200-300 yards wide. The tornado then impacted KY 527 (Saloma Road) where more structures had significant damage. At one particular residence, the entire second floor of the brick home was removed. Hundreds of trees near and just beyond the road had been snapped or uprooted. Damage in this area consisted of EF-1 to EF-2 ratings. The tornado continued to intensify to the northeast as it impacted Sanders Road. It was here where the worst damage (EF-3) was observed. Wide swaths of forest, over a quarter mile wide, were completely snapped or uprooted. Drone imagery showed some ground scarring in concentrated areas. Homes in the direct path of the tornado were severely damaged with no walls left standing. The tornado weakened some as it continued toward Marion County. Several homes had missing or severely damaged roofs near Old Lebanon Road. Trees were uprooted or snapped.

The tornado began northwest of Macksburg in western Madision county.  The tornado remained in mostly rural cropland and wooded areas of western Madison county.  The tornado passed through Pammel State Park southwest of Winterset producing extensive tree damage as the tornado continued to widen into a wedge tornado.  Upon exiting the park, the tornado travelled along Carver Road.  Several residential homes were extensively damaged or destroyed along Carver Road and six deaths occurred along this stretch of road.  The tornado was at peak intensity at this time with EF4 damage occurring west of the intersection of Carver Road and Highway 169 with a house completely destoyed and removed from the foundation.  After departing the Carver Road corridor, the tornado progressed just southeast of Winterset and eventually passed east of town and crossing State Highway 92.  Damage in these areas was primarily to trees and outbuildings although a few homes were also impacted with mostly EF1 to EF2 damage.  From Highway 92 to where the tornado exited the county, it remained mostly in rural cropland and wooded areas with numerous trees impacted.  The tornado then moved into Warren county from Madison county.","On March 5, 2022 a total of 15 tornadoes occurred across the state of Iowa as a warm front lifted across the area. Supercells initially developed across southwest Iowa in the vicinity of the triple point of the surface low with strong, rotating updrafts. Longevity was initially lacking with the storms, producing funnel clouds, brief tornadoes, and hail in southwest Iowa. As the cells moved northeast and matured, larger hail began to fall with golf ball sized hail falling in Adams county and baseball sized hail into Adair county. Following this period of large hail the storms produced a tornado which would remain on the ground for just over 70 miles, carving a path across central Iowa from southwest of Winterset to just northeast of Newton. The tornado peaked in Winterset, Iowa, producing EF-4 damage with wind speeds estimated near 170 mph. The tornado continued across the southern portion of the Des Moines metro area and to Newton. This is the furthest north EF-4 tornado in the CONUS this early in the year on record, the first EF-4 tornado in Iowa since October 4, 2013 which occurred in Woodbury and Cherokee Counties, and is the second longest tornado in Iowa since 1980, behind the longest occurring on June 7, 1984 at a length of 117 miles across southern Iowa. As the storm skimmed the southern Des Moines metro, cells across south central became tornadic, producing several destructive tornadoes including an EF-3 tornado in Chariton, Iowa.

The tornado is believed to have begun near Halsell Ranch Rd and Barton Chapel Road where tree damage was observed. The first significant damage noted was on Kinder Mountain Road where the blades of 4 wind turbines were shredded, significant tree damage was observed, and damage to a home and storage barns was observed. The winds were likely EF2 strength in this location. The tornado continued to be tracked to the northeast by observing mostly minor house/roof damage and notable tree damage. As the tornado approached Jacksboro from the southwest it appeared to strengthen and widen. EF2 damage was observed to a secured manufactured home on ONeal Lane and also through the Synterra Estates neighborhood, just south of Highway 380 and west of FM 4. From here, the tornado moved into the western portions of Jacksboro where many homes sustained EF2 damage from Burwick Road all the way to the High School north of Highway 380. The tornado was approximately half a mile wide as it moved through this part of the city. Considerable roof damage and tree damage was observed in this area. Some walls on homes were impacted, and some structures that were not well secured collapsed. The tornado reached EF3 strength as it approached Wichita Avenue and the Jacksboro Elementary School. One well built home on Wichita Avenue suffered very significant roof damage along with other noted damage that indicated winds over 135 mph. From there, the tornado directly struck the elementary school where it ripped the roof off the gymnasium, causing one wall to collapse, bent flag poles to the ground, overturned cars, and more. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado moved through the high school campus, also ripping part of the roof off the high school, damaging the press box at the stadium, bending the field goal posts, bending a light pole to the ground, and more.

It then intensified and caused a swath of EF-2 tree damage that extended from Zion Road near Chisolm Cemetary Road to Chisolm Harbrook Road and Highway 495 South and continuing to the north of Damascus. A large number of trees sustained considerable damage along this swath with several stands of mature trees completely leveled. A home was shifted off of its foundation and a mobile home was destroyed from a fallen tree near the intersection of Chisolm Cemetary Road and Zion Road. The tornado began to intensify as it neared Curtis Fulton Road. Here, the tornado destroyed an anchored shed with metal framing. The most intense damage was located along Smith-Galloway Road. Here, the tornado destroyed a four month old manufactured home. All of the anchoring straps of the home were either snapped or pulled out of the ground, including the anchors themselves. Indications are that the home was likely thrown approximately 100 yards into a stand of trees behind the home. The tornado continued to cause significant tree damage as it crossed a field. The tornado reached its peak intensity of EF3, with 145mph winds, as it destroyed a family home. In addition a horse trailer was also tossed from across the street and significant numbers of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped, including another stand of mature pines that was flattened.

The most intense damage was from the riverbank to the canal in Arabi. It was a very narrow, intense tornado with two areas of concentrated EF3 damage. One was a house that was swept off its raised foundation with all walls and the roof destroyed. This was near where the one fatality occurred. Due to poor construction, this was EF3. The highest EF3 rating was given to a house that was constructed in the last 6 months. While this house was raised on cinder blocks, every tower of blocks had strapping to the house. The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation. The house itself held together but was shifted about 50 yards to the north and rotated about 90 degrees. The house next door was also swept off the foundation, moved and mostly destroyed. This also had some evidence of strapping to the slab foundation. This area is what will justify the 160 MPH EF3 rating. Most if not all houses on the south to north path within a 4 block west to east range received minor to substantial roof damage with many houses seeing walls collapsed, leaving interior rooms intact. The tornado then damaged electrical towers on the bank of the canal before moving northeast across Intercoastal Waterway back into Orleans Parish.","An upper level system moved into north-central Texas on March 22nd.

On Gilberts Mill Rd near Stewart Rd, a barn was destroyed and a manufactured home was damaged and shifted on its foundation, which is in line with EF-1 damage. Snapped and uprooted trees were observed all along Gilberts Mill Rd. Further northeast, a manufactured home sustained significant damage and several outbuildings were destroyed. A camper and a greenhouse were also destroyed here, consistent with EF-1 damage. The tornado strengthened as it continued northeastward along Gilberts Mill Rd before completely destroying and sweeping away an anchored double wide manufactured home and a newer, anchored single wide home. The double wide home was the site of the two fatalities, and one person in the single wide was injured when he was thrown into the tree line grasping his mattress. Several projectiles were driven into the ground at this location. A large boat was also thrown from its trailer and overturned. Damage at this location was consistent with strong EF-2 winds.  The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved across Jewel Rd and at that location, a well-built brick home was partially destroyed and likely was sideswiped by the tornado. The end of the home that was hit sustained major collapse of roof and exterior brick walls as well as a generator ripped from its anchoring and thrown across a field. The other end of the home was less severely damaged but still suffered major roof loss. A car in the driveway was pushed off of the driveway, and an attached carport was destroyed. Across the street, a wood frame home with block foundation was completely destroyed and swept from the foundation, leaving only some cinder blocks and a floor joist. The debris from the house was thrown into a pole barn which was also destroyed. An injury occurred at this site when the home occupant ran to the barn and dove under his pickup truck.

The tornado continued to move east northeast for almost 16 additional miles before dissipating around 1.75 miles northeast of Sparr. The tornado was rated EF3 in Otsego county based on damage surveyed in multiple locations around the Gaylord area. The first of these locations was damage in the Nottingham Forest manufactured home community. Multiple units were completely destroyed with debris blown away from the original locations of the units (DI 4, DOD 12). The second location was the business district of Gaylord where the buildings of Hobby Lobby, Maurices, and Jimmy Johns experienced collapses of exterior walls where interior walls remained standing (DI 10, DOD 8). The last location, which had the highest estimated wind speed of 150 mph, was damage found to homes on Berkshire Ln on the northeast side of Gaylord. Most exterior walls were collapsed and only partial interior walls were left standing (DI 2, DOD 8).  The tornado dissipated at 1457 EST about 1.75 miles northeast of Sparr. Two fatalities were reported in the Nottingham Forest community, along with 44 injuries reported from various locations around Gaylord. The maximum path width in Otsego county was 200 yards.","Multiple thunderstorms tracked across northern Michigan during the afternoon, including a supercell thunderstorm that produced the EF-3 tornado that hit the town of Gaylord along with very large hail in other parts of the area. ||Setting the stage for severe weather was a trough that rotated across the upper Midwest that developed and strengthened surface low pressure west of Lake Michigan. This system helped draw a warm, moist airmass northward across the state that helped provide the instability necessary to support severe thunderstorms later in the day. Storms initially formed along the cold front across Wisconsin during the morning hours and moved northeast across Lake Michigan, making it into the forecast area by early afternoon. The strongest line segment generated a measured wind gust of 76 mph at Frankfort Light and continued to produce damaging wind gusts across Leelanau and Antrim counties as it quickly moved northeast.||As this segment moved further away from the cold front, it began to transition into a supercell thunderstorm. This storm moved east-northeast across a very favorable environment in place across northern lower Michigan, eventually producing a tornado that caused considerable damage in the city of Gaylord. This supercell continued to trek across the area, producing baseball-sized hail in Posen.||For additional context, this was the first time in reliable recorded history (since 1950) that Gaylord was hit by a tornado.

The tornado continued into Choctaw County Oklahoma and additional information about the damage in that county can be found in a separate entry. Several dozen individual homes, businesses and outbuildings were impacted across western and northern Lamar County.  Damage consistent with EF-3 intensity tornadic winds of 150-160 mph were identified at several locations west through north of Paris.  In particular, several residences along Farm Market Road 1499 northwest of Paris were completely unroofed, with most external and internal walls destroyed.  This damage was consistent with tornado intensities of approximately 160 mph. One particular house on CR 33620 revealed EF-4 damage, with estimated winds of at least 170 MPH. EF-3 damage of 145 to 155 mph was also identified with a small number of structures along Farm to Market Road 906 near Mideity, as well as with a residence along Farm to Market Road 2820 west-northwest of Paris.  Primary damage to these structures was the total loss of roofs and large-scale interior and exterior wall failure. EF-2 damage, consistent with winds of 111 to 135 mph, was identified with a number of other structures along the tornado's path.  Structures with this degree of damage had either all or large portions of their roofs destroyed or significantly damaged, with some wall failures.  Widespread EF-1 damage was also apparent all along the track from Brookston to east of Arthur City, as evidenced by trees uprooted, power poles snapped, outbuildings severely damaged, and/or wood frame homes with serious roof damage. Maximum estimated winds were 170 mph.","A fast-moving cold front served as a focus for thunderstorm development across North and Central Texas, as an upper level storm system swept across the Plains the afternoon of November 4.

An aerial survey confirmed that the tornado damage was to tin metal roof panels that were peeled off of a plant on CR-1200. As the tornado continued northeast, near FM-411, a single family home had all of its walls removed with only the interior room left standing where a family of three sheltered where winds were estimated at 150 mph. After it crossed FM-411, it hit another single family home and collapsed all the walls, injuring a woman who left her vehicle to take shelter inside the home. The tornado continued on to CR-1275 where debarking of a few trees was first observed in addition to thousands of trees that were snapped and uprooted throughout the path of the tornado. It then crossed US-82, CR-2123, CR-2124, and FM-2283. At FM-2283, it destroyed a single family home along with several outbuildings. This area could not be surveyed at this location as debris removal had already begun. The tornado then continued to move along CR-2125 and CR-2030 before taking a more eastward jog across SH-37. At this point, it is estimated that it was about a third of a mile wide and it began to widen further as it demonstrated more widespread tree snaps and isolated debarking throughout the remainder of Red River County. After crossing SH-37, the tornado wiped a single family home off of its foundation north of Clarksville with large portions of the walls and roof carried several hundred yards northeast of the home. This damage was surrounded by widespread tree snaps with isolated debarking. This location was reviewed by a regional Quick Response Team (QRT) that determined the damage at this location was EF-4 with maximum winds of 170 mph. This was based on the construction of the home, the debris field spread 50-200 yards downstream from the home in small pieces, and the slab of the home being wiped clean. Ten people on the property of the home took shelter in an oil drain of a metal outbuilding that was completely destroyed with no injuries. The damage swath widened to approximately 0.6 miles northeast of Clarksville as it approached Acworth and continued to cross the Red River. Before it crossed the Red River, it collapsed all the walls on a single family home and completely destroyed Mount Olive Church. It then lifted a double-wide manufactured home off the ground near FM-1159 and threw it 50 yards with three dogs inside that all survived. The tornado then crossed the Red River into south-central McCurtain County, Oklahoma.","A strong upper level trough progressed through the Rockies and into the Central and Southern Plains during the day on November 4th, enhancing strong surface low development over the Upper Red River Valley into Oklahoma. This produced a strong pressure gradient over the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley, allowing for very rich Gulf moisture to surge north across the Ark-La-Tex area into Eastern Oklahoma and much of Arkansas. This generated moderate instability across these areas during the afternoon, as temperatures rose into the lower to mid 80s. Very strong wind shear was also in place over these areas, with the upper trough reinforcing a cold front southeast into Southeast Oklahoma, Western Arkansas, and East Texas. This trough enhanced large scale forcing along the front, with discrete supercell development also occurring ahead of the main line of storms over portions of East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, and Southwest Arkansas.

This tornado had weakened upon entering Southern McCurtain County Oklahoma, producing EF-2 damage in rural areas southwest of Idabel, ripping the roofs off of several single family homes. Shortly before entering Idabel, the outer edge of this tornado hit the Oklahoma Mesonet observing platform located about 5 miles to the southwest off of Ravens Nest Road. An anemometer located 10 meters above the platform measured a wind gust of 108 mph, with a nearby single family home sustaining roof damage where EF-2 winds estimated near 125 mph removed a large section of the roof structure with a wall collapsing on another single family home off of Osprey Road. The tornado continued on to snap several hundred trees before hitting a single family home off of Boss Road which had a wall collapse and partial roof damage that could not be rated due to trees falling into the home. More EF-2 damage was observed as the tornado approached Highway 259 when the tornado removed the roof and much of the second story off of a single family home. The two people in the home took shelter on the first floor under the stairs, preventing injury as winds estimated at 125 mph damaged the home. As the tornado moved northeast across Stone Haven Road, a Davis weather station recorded a gust of approximately 130 mph. ||Upon entering Idabel, the tornado damaged additional roofs of homes in several neighborhoods on the southeast side of town. One of the most hard hit subdivisions was Country Club Estates. None of the homes in the Country Club Estates were rated due to tree damage which resulted in much of the structural damage from trees falling into homes. Nearby at the Idabel Country Club, nearly every tree sustained damage on approximately six holes, with mostly snaps observed. There was also some debarking of trees in this area, where an EF-3 swath of damage had begun. Behind the golf course, a single family home was destroyed with most of its walls collapsed except for a small interior room. ||The tornado continued to move northeast, hitting the Kiamichi Family Medical Center where EF-2 damage (near 115 mph) was estimated due to the facade components that were torn from the structure. As the tornado approached Highway 259 and East Washington Street, it damaged the sign of a McDonald's and a swath of EF-3 winds completely destroyed the Donut Crossing and Express Tire stores. A sign from the Donut Crossing store was lofted by the tornado and carried 14.3 miles where it was found on the west side of Eagletown. After crossing East Washington Street, the tornado completely destroyed the Trinity Baptist Church. Winds at this location were estimated to be near 155 mph with the total destruction of the metal building system which was surrounded by a brick wall that collapsed with concrete anchors pulled up from the ground. The tornado moved on to produce narrow EF-2 damage in the more broader EF-1 damage swath with small vorticies likely extending down to the ground from the elevated large funnel cloud at this point. ||After moving northeast of Idabel, the tornado crossed mainly rural areas and completely destroyed chicken houses while snapping hardwood and softwood trees for approximately the next ten miles. An areal survey indicates that the tornado briefly lifted near the Little River and then touched down again in a forested area before damaging a metal structure atop a chicken plant off of Craig Road. A survey team from the National Weather Service Little Rock office found EF-2 damage with 135 mph winds between Eagletown and Broken Bow just south of Highway 70, where numerous trees and several wooden utility poles were snapped near the base near the Tyson Craig Feed Mill, a large elevator structure on top of a silo collapsed with a portion of a metal roof and walls ripped off of an adjacent metal building, and a doublewide manufactured home at the eastern end of Box Turtle Road was thrown off of its concrete pad, nearly pulling out an underground shelter, rolling over it, and landing about 30 feet to the north. Over half of the house was stripped of the undercarriage. Only about one-third of the walls/roof were left with the remainder of the structure removed and scattered well to the north. ||As the tornado crossed Highway 70 just west of Eagletown, many additional pines and hardwoods were snapped and uprooted. Nearly all utility poles within the path were also snapped or pushed over. The tornado then moved into a heavily forested area north of Eagletown with more specific damage noted from Old Winship Road to Pero Creek through the use of high-resolution satellite imagery before the tornado finally lifted a few miles before reaching the border with Northwestern Sevier County in Southwest Arkansas. ||Remarkedly, only 6 injuries and no fatalities were reported from this long track tornado throughout Southern and Eastern McCurtain County Oklahoma.

A few mobile homes were destroyed near the start of the tornado which resulted in several injuries. The tornado continued to track northeast from Texas Highway 11 to Highway 49, doing mostly EF-1 damage for 3 miles before reaching Highway 49. As the tornado crossed Highway 49, two nearby homes were completely destroyed and largely swept from their foundations and at least one injury resulted. This damage was only rated EF-2 because of the pier and beam foundation construction of both homes did not anchor the structures well to the intense wind loading. Behind the homes, some isolated tree debarking was observed with a swath of EF-3 damage with maximum winds of 140 mph. The tornado continued to the northeast, completely destroying a mobile home along CR-3201, where one fatality associated with this tornado occurred.

This tornado was determined to be the strongest one produced by this particular thunderstorm and generated a few spots of low end EF-3 damage in several locations along its nearly 16-mile long path, with estimated maximum winds near 140 mph. This tornado first touched down along U.S. Highway 67 to the southwest of Simms and quickly grew in strength and width after tracking a few miles, briefing reaching a width of nearly a half mile at times. Just west of Simms and continuing northeast just past FM-561, the tornado produced many instances of EF-2 damage to both trees and structures. As the tornado crossed FM-561, there were several structures, a few well built, which had roofs and many walls removed, with 140 mph winds estimated here which were just inside the EF-3 threshold. Additionally, near this structural damage, there was a small section of asphalt road removed from FM-561 and the road debris was thrown into one residence. From there, the tornado then tracked northeast nearly four miles through very rural and uninhabited areas west of Texas Highway 98. The tornado finally moved back over Highway 98 and produced another area of considerable damage at the intersection of Highway 98 and CR-1840. In this area, several structures were largely destroyed, including a few small retail buildings, and this again garnered some high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 ratings with no injuries. After this point, the tornado travelled its final seven miles by crossing the southwestern, then western, and then northern portions of the city of New Boston, before ending just west of Highway 8 north of Interstate 30.

The most intense damage of the tornado occurred here as two residences were essentially destroyed. One residence was a one or two family residence which had its roof and most of its walls removed, with many interior walls collapsed. One injury occurred at this home, but fortunately, was not significant. A nearby single-wide mobile home was also destroyed from this tornado. In addition, many barns and/or outbuildings were destroyed in this general location and at least several livestock were killed. The peak 140 mph EF-3 rating of this tornado occurred here as well, due to observed tree debarking near the one or two family residence. Significant ground scouring near where the livestock were killed was also observed. This ground scouring is usually a trait associated with very intense tornado vorticies, but it is not an official damage indicator used to rate tornadoes. ||From this location, the tornado continued roughly 3.5 miles east-northeast before crossing Wyant Road and the Twelve Mile Post Road intersection. The survey team did not have access in the 3.5 mile span before this intersection, but used available drone footage to confirm significant swaths of tree damage in this gap. Only tree damage was observed along Wyant Road, but the high level of tree snapping was enough to confirm EF-2 strength here. From here, the tornado continued along Wyant Road, which had turned northeast to criss-cross the tornado's path through the hillier terrain. The tornado damage showed a tendency for the tornado to narrow and weaken at times through the terrain, but it did continue without lifting until reaching the Ouachita River. Along the southwestern bank of the river, there were two homes that received significant damage and several outbuildings were totally destroyed with debris thrown into the river. The tornado crossed the river and did significant tree damage along Lee Lane. From there, the tornado continued east-northeast while gradually narrowing and weakening, crossing Highway 559 and Parish Road 6629.

The tornado then briefly moved back over the lake before crossing Highway 2 where several single family homes were heavily damaged and at least a few shops and outbuildings destroyed. The most heavily damaged structure, warranting a 130 mph wind speed estimate, was a two story home which had its roof and much of the second story removed or destroyed. Two injuries occurred within this home, although both were non-critical. The tornado then tracked over a small portion of the lake again before coming ashore and moving across Corney Creek Drive and Dozier Road. In this area, there were several residences damaged by falling trees, although one cabin was largely destroyed due to a combination of falling trees and wind forcing. ||The tornado then tracked over a nearly 2 mile span where the survey team had no access, although a tornado debris signature on radar gave confidence that the circulation remained on the ground. The tornado had grown to a width of approximately 500 yards by the time it next crossed Denton Road, where many EF-2 damage indicators were found and four single family homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. One double-wide mobile home here was thrown and completely destroyed, with 5 injuries reported. A single-wide mobile home was also thrown and destroyed, although no injuries were known to the survey team at this location. Two one or two family homes in this location also suffered damage to roofs and some walls. Additionally, extreme tree damage with at least a few trees exhibiting some debarking were found in this area as well. Significant tree damage continued to the northeast as the tornado crossed Highway 15 and moved across Camp Road. ||The most significant damage associated with this tornado occurred in the Camp Road area as the 400-500 yard wide tornado struck an apartment complex and an adjacent mobile home park. Here, seven of the nine single-wide mobile homes were thrown or completely destroyed. It is estimated that the strongest core of the tornadic winds only clipped the south end of the apartment complex, but one building in this area had a large portion of its roof and some exterior walls removed. This damage warranted the peak 140 mph EF-3 rating of the tornado with widespread mid to strong EF-2 damage occurring throughout this area. According to Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, of the 74 units at this housing complex, only 12 of them were habitable following this tornado. The survey team received a confirmation of 14 total injuries, two of which were critical, from this tornado. However, details of which injuries occurred in associated to the various damaged structures along Camp Road were not known. ||Afterwards, the tornado moved through a nearly 2 mile long heavily forested area inaccessible to the survey team,  although the team did confirm strong EF-2 level tree damage did continue well into this forested area east of Camp Road. The tornado did weaken considerably as it crossed Feazel Road after traversing the wooded area. Here, only EF-1 level structural and tree damage was found. The tornado continued to track another mile or so, producing only EF-0 damage to trees before lifting along Sweet Lily Road.","A strong upper level low pressure system shifted northeast out of the Central Rockies across Eastern Colorado and Northwest Kansas during the day on December 13th, which allowed for surface low pressure to develop along an attendant cold front that extended south across Western Kansas into Western Oklahoma and Northwest Texas. Meanwhile, a tightening pressure gradient ahead of the front resulted in strong southerly low level winds across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley, with an increase in warmer, more humid and unstable air spreading back north into East Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Large scale forcing increased during the afternoon across East Texas ahead of the approaching upper trough, along a dry line that had mixed east ahead of the cold front. Thus, scattered showers and thunderstorms developed across much of East Texas and Western Louisiana, before becoming more numerous as they spread east across North-central Louisiana. Some of these storms became severe across North Louisiana as they tapped the strongly sheared air mass in place and the better instability contributed from daytime heating. A couple of isolated strong tornadoes were spawned across extreme Southwest Caddo Parish near the Four Forks community, as well as near Farmerville in Central Union Parish. These storms exited the region into Northeast Louisiana by late evening.",69

This long-track tornado began west of Highway 82, where timber damage occurred to farms near the community of Independence. The tornado crossed Highway 82 and strengthened as a manufactured home was rolled along Autauga County Road 40. Over the next two miles, the tornado rapidly strengthened as it approached the Old Kingston community, where EF3 damage began along County Road 43. At this location, at least three manufactured homes were obliterated with their frames thrown up to 100 yards. A pickup truck was sent airborne and landed 120 yards to the northeast, where a shallow crater was formed by its impact. The tornado became deadly as it impacted several homes along Sandy Ridge Road. The frame of a manufactured home at the western end of the road was thrown 250 yards to the north-northeast and came to rest in a field. Just downstream, several manufactured homes in a cluster were shredded and thrown considerable distances. Trees were snapped off relatively close to the ground and partially debarked. In total, five fatalities occurred along Sandy Ridge Road at three separate residences. Similar damage continued to the northeast along County Road 140, where two fatalities occurred in two separate residences at the eastern end of the road. At least five manufactured homes were blown away with their frames thrown considerable distances. Several vehicles were picked up and thrown, and one pickup truck had its cab separated from the bed. From this area to County Road 42, the tornado caused massive tree damage and what appeared to be stands of debarked trees along Autauga Creek. In the three mile stretch of most severe damage from County Road 43 to County Road 42, wind speeds reached at least 150 mph. The tornado tracked across County Road 57 at a slightly weaker state, where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted with several homes sustaining significant roof damage with one site-built home also sustaining partial wall failure. The tornado crossed Interstate 65 where numerous trees were uprooted. In the Pine Level community, several homes sustained roof damage and a manufactured home was rolled off its foundation and onto County Road 68. Many trees were uprooted and snapped as the tornado crossed through the Pine Flat community. Additional homes sustained roof damage and other damage from fallen trees, and a manufactured home was rolled and destroyed. Residential structure damage intensified as the tornado neared the Autauga/Elmore county line where several site-built homes sustained a majority or entire roof removal along County Road 68 near Poplar Springs Road.  The tornado crossed into Elmore County just north of Highway 68.","Numerous strong to severe thunderstorms impacted Central Alabama during the morning and afternoon hours of Thursday, January 12th, 2023.

Structural damage across Coosa County continued to consist of roof uplift or removal and damage from wind-blown debris and fallen trees.  A manufactured home was destroyed near Highway 231 along with numerous uprooted trees. Radar showed a debris ball in southern Coosa County which matched ground observations of a truly extensive area of snapped pine trees along McKissick Road, located between the communities of Speed and Equality. The volume of snapped trees was enough to assign an EF3 rating for this segment of the tornado path. Additional significant damage occurred along County Road 18 where vehicles were moved or flipped, numerous trees were snapped, and site-built homes were heavily damaged with one destroyed. This was another area assigned EF-3 intensity. The tornado continued northeastward toward the Coosa/Tallapoosa county line where additional, relatively less intense timber damage was noted.

Our analysis determined that this tornado would become the dominant circulation which impacted Griffin and much of Spalding County and Southern Henry County. The tornado first touched down in Northwest Pike County along HWY 362 west of Irish Hill Drive where a few trees were snapped and uprooted and quickly increased in intensity to EF1 as it crossed Kings Bridge Road, Huff Creek Rd and Scott Road where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. As the storm crossed Blanton Mill Road more severe damage was noted both on the ground and areal survey and it was determined that EF2 damage was present in the area around Nunnally Rd and Bethany Road where widespread snapping of trees occurred and a few structures were severely damaged. However, the updated analysis shows that this area also experienced crossing tornado paths both from this tornado and another which struck the area approximately 2 minutes later.

Crossing MS 826 and along |Fleetwood Rd, an older metal building was swept away, a small home|was destroyed and numerous manufactured homes were destroyed. ||As the tornado moved into the western side of Rolling Fork, the |tornadic wind field was broad, encompassing the area from Race St, |where exterior damage occurred to the Sharkey Issaquena Hospital, to |Bear Lake Rd on the south end where several utility poles were |snapped. The corridor of greatest damage on the west side of the |city, rated high end EF3, extended from 7th St between Martin Ave |and Joor Ave to 3rd St between Southern Ave and Lewis Ave. In this |area, multiple homes lost most exterior walls, several more lost |roofs and some walls, and even more received at least minor damage. |Two fatalities occurred along 7th St when a trailer truck was tossed |into a home. Through this corridor, additional debarking of trees |was noted near the center of the path. Brief and minor weakening |occurred as the tornado moved east of 3rd St and began to approach |Deer Creek, with EF2 damage still common. Along the creek, the |fire station, Rolling Fork Elementary School, and South Delta High|School all sustained roof and other exterior damage.||After the tornado crossed Deer Creek and began to move into the |downtown area of Rolling Fork, reintensification occurred. |Additional EF4 damage was noted in the block between Sharkey St and |Worthington Ave and north of Collette Ave where a home and a duplex |apartment were entirely demolished, with the foundation of the |duplex partially swept. Large metal buildings at an agriculture |business at the intersection of East St and West Ave were destroyed. |A fatality occurred when a mobile home along Worthington Ave was |destroyed. On Parkway Ave, a Masonic lodge was leveled and a gas |station was substantially damaged. ||The tornado then crossed Rolling Fork Creek, damaging and destroying |several structures along McLaurin St and China St. A water tower |east of Hicks Ave, which was in service at the time of the tornado, |was felled in a southeastward direction, perpendicular to the |tornado path. In the downtown area, the roof was removed from the |Rolling Fork US Post Office, portions of Rolling Fork City Hall, and |portions of the Rolling Fork Police Department. The Sharkey County |Courthouse received damage to the roof and some windows, with the |cupola removed. Additional EF4 damage was observed as the tornado |crossed Walnut St, with multiple homes and businesses having all or |most walls downed. One building in this corridor was compromised by |two tossed tractor trailers and another was compromised by a |southward facing metal door. A fatality occurred when a mobile home |off Sidney Alexander St north of Walnut St was destroyed.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it approached US Highway |61 just north of Walnut St. Multiple brick homes along Mulberry St |were leveled, with debris remaining on the foundations. A discount |retail chain store was completely destroyed, with much of the debris |swept to the downstream side of the foundation and rowed along the |tornado path. Two people died at this location. A gift/floral shop |was destroyed, with most debris swept from the foundation. |Additional businesses, including a lumber/hardware store, two |restaurants, a furniture store, and an insurance agency were also |destroyed in this area. One occupant of a truck traveling along US |61 was killed when the tornado tossed his vehicle from the highway |to near the lumber/hardware store. A mobile/manufactured home park |on the east side of US 61 was devastated, with all 30-35 homes |destroyed. Considerable debris from these homes was rowed 300-400|yards downstream along the tornado path into an adjacent field |and stand of trees. Six occupants of these homes died in the |tornado.||The tornado remained strong to violent as it continued northeast of |Rolling Fork across mainly open fields. Through these fields, aerial |imagery revealed multiple areas of ground scarring. The tornado |crossed Matthews Rd near a catfish farm, where several utility poles |were snapped near the ground and covered in 1 to 2 inches of mud. |Some of the poles were tossed into nearby ponds. Prolific tree |damage occurred along Sandy Bayou, with a few buildings along the |outer edges of the path damaged and a tractor trailer flipped. |Another area of EF4 damage was observed from Widow Bayou and E River |Rd northeastward through Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd. Through this |corridor, extraordinary hardwood tree damage occurred with most |trees completely mangled and debarking noted. There was additional |evidence of trees or large parts of trees being tossed or dragged a |short distance. Several utility poles were snapped, with some tossed |a short distance. An outbuilding type structure off Dogwood Rd was |blown away, with a school bus from the property tossed into nearby |trees. Ground scarring and cycloidal marks were observed in the |field between Dogwood Rd and Linsey Rd, along with mulched tree |debris which was rowed into a narrow line along the center of the |tornado path. Tree damage continued across Keith Rd and Charlie Pitt |Rd as the tornado approached MS Highway 14.||East of Anguilla along MS Highway 14, a frame home was completely|destroyed. Near the home, several power poles were snapped or |broken. Tree damage was extensive with large areas mowed down. A |tenth of a mile east, a mobile home was rolled into nearby trees. |Moving into Humphreys County, along Prudent Rd, most of the roof |was taken off of a home, where the garage collapsed along with a |portion of the front porch. One vehicle was flipped and another |was moved. A metal workshop was destroyed and structural beams |were bent. Along the road, several power poles were snapped and |thrown a couple hundred feet into a nearby field. As the tornado |approached and crossed Seven Mile Rd, intensity increased. Here, |several metal buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed with |structural beams bent. Grain bins had sides collapsed and the tops|blown off. A small brick home was completely destroyed with all |of the exterior walls collapsed. The home next door had a large |portion of the roof removed and part of a wall had collapsed. |Debris from the home was thrown several hundred feet into a nearby|field. Vehicles were moved out of the garage and a large grain |storage cart was thrown into the field as well. ||For several miles, the tornado traveled along MS Highway 149 |moving toward Silver City where large areas of hardwood trees were|snapped and uprooted. Multiple center pivot irrigation systems |were flipped. A mobile home was completely destroyed when it was |rolled into a nearby field. A portion of the roof was blown off a |school. A community along the same road had several homes with |significant roof damage, and at least one home had decking |material partially removed. Several homes and a large metal |building were severely damaged when portions of the roof were |blown off. A second metal building was completely destroyed with |large structural posts bent. ||As the tornado came into Silver City from the west along Highway |149, an apartment complex was heavily damaged. Several buildings |had sections of the roof removed and one building had portions of |the western walls partially collapsed. A fatality occurred in one|of the single story apartment buildings. In the nearby |neighborhood, numerous homes had roof damage. At least two frame |homes were destroyed where one or more exterior walls collapsed. A|large number of old hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted. As |the storm moved east toward US 49W, more trees were snapped and |uprooted. Several homes and a church near the intersection of |MS Highway 14 and US 49W had areas of the roof damaged or |removed. Four mobile homes were completely destroyed. One person |died when a mobile home was tossed into a house, and a child died|in one of the mobile homes that was destroyed. Numerous trees |were snapped and uprooted, a few of which fell on homes. The |rating in the Silver City area ranged from EF1-EF2. ||The tornado continued to track east where mostly tree damage |occurred. In rural portions of Holmes County northeast of Tchula, |there was substantial tree damage with swaths of snapped and |uprooted trees. Several center pivot irrigation systems were |overturned and grain bins were flipped or destroyed. The tornado |continued to move northeast before dissipating in a wooded area |north of Randall Road.","In the afternoon and evening of the 24th, clusters of strong to severe storms were stretched from southwest to northeast across southeastern Arkansas as robust instability and very strong wind shear served to produce a volatile severe weather environment.

At this point, the tornado began to substantially increase in size and intensity. A very high percentage of trees were snapped along the path through a wooded area south of Bear Lake Rd. It was in this wooded area where the first indications of EF3 to EF4 damage were noted, with at least one tree and root ball and several more large tree pieces fully displaced into the downstream field. From this point along the path in Sharkey County, there was a well defined confluence zone in damage along the center of the tornado track. On the western outskirts of the city of Rolling Fork, homes began to be impacted with significant roof damage along Bear Lake Rd. Several tall wooden utility transmission poles were snapped along Bear Lake Rd and MS Highway 826.

Several structures sustained significant damage, including the total destruction of a couple of single-wide, manufactured homes. Numerous trees and utility poles were heavily damaged in the area and roof damage was noted on several homes. |Several injuries were reported in this area. The tornado continued to move northeast, crossing White Rock Road and causing widespread, significant tree damage, and roof damage to several homes in the path. The tornado strengthened further as it approached McAllister Road. Several homes in the area of McAllister and Herndon Roads suffered significant damage with missing roofs and collapsed walls. A single-wide, manufactured home on Herndon Road was separated from its frame and completely destroyed, resulting in 2 fatalities and multiple significant injuries. Tree damage was severe with many hardwood trees snapped or uprooted. Additional home and widespread, significant tree damage was observed along Whatley Road near the intersection with Highway 45 East south of New Wren. The tornado was nearly one mile wide at this point. One manufactured home was destroyed with debris blown 200 yards down to the highway. A church was destroyed and several homes suffered significant damage. Several homes sustained severe damage along Little Coontail Road, including the complete destruction of multiple manufactured homes. A boat was tossed more than 50 yards and an SUV was thrown into a tree. Some of this damage along Highway 45 East and Little Coontail Road was rated EF3. Farther east along Coontail Road, damage to homes was less significant and was generally confined to minor roof damage. However, severe tree damage continued. The tornado then moved into more wooded, wetland areas, crossing Highway 278 where it intersects with the Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway. Widespread, significant damage to homes and trees was observed all throughout the northern half of Amory. Several locations in Amory sustained damage rated as EF3. The tornado continued to cause damage to trees and homes as it moved across the Amory Golf Course and then affected Myrtle and Elliott Roads. A few homes suffered significant roof damage to the south of Smithville near Parham Store Road and Williams Young Road and widespread tree damage continued. The tornado path began to narrow as the storm moved into northern Monroe County with tree damage found along Highway 23 and State Line Road.  Peak winds were estimated at 155 mph in Monroe County.","The first significant event to produce widespread severe weather across the Mid-South for 2023 occurred on March 24, during the afternoon and evening hours.  This severe weather episode occurred mainly over portions of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. Surface analysis for this day depicted a quasi-stationary boundary from the Mid-Atlantic States and Ohio Valley through northern portions of West Tennessee and Arkansas and stretching back through Central Texas. Low pressure tracked along the stalled front into southeast Missouri during the evening. Meanwhile, a potent mid-level trough ejected out of the southwest U.S. Upper air analysis indicated the Lower Mississippi Valley was in the right entrance region of a strong 300 mb upper-level jet streak. This produced sufficient upper-level divergence and lift needed for severe thunderstorm development. ||Moderate instability combined with strong wind shear resulted in a QLCS (Quasi-Linear Convective System) convective mode. This northern part of the QLCS initially started over Western Arkansas Friday afternoon and moved east into Eastern Arkansas by early evening and then across West Tennessee. The northern part of QLCS produced scattered wind damage, flash flooding, and a weak tornado.

The tornado tracked northeastward, doing minor structural damage to a machine shed along County Highway 1 near Pierceburg.  Numerous wooden power poles were snapped and heavy damage to trees was noted with tops sheared off about 30 feet above ground.  Structural damage to homes of the EF1-EF2 variety occurred as the tornado moved across County Highway 15 where two single family homes sustained major roof damage.  A mobile home was torn in half with its debris strewn about 20 yards in opposite directions.  Trees, while sparse in this area, were sheared about 20-30 feet above the ground.  Further east along County Highway 15, structural damage occurred to a large machine shed where a stationary semi-trailer blew into its west-facing wall causing the entire structure to fail.  The debris from the large machine shed then blew into an old, poorly anchored single-family residence and caused exterior walls to slide off its foundation.  Over the next 3 miles along the path of the tornado just before it reached the south side of Robinson, considerable tree damage was observed.||As the tornado tracked into the south side of Robinson, it narrowly missed a major oil refinery.  The tornado destroyed two manufactured homes resulting in two fatalities as it crossed County Highway 9 near the interchange of East 900th Avenue and North 1200th Street.  Damage to structures, trees, and wooden power poles was determined to be EF1-EF2.||Heavy structural damage (EF3) and an additional fatality were noted on the east side of Robinson near the interchange of State Highway 1 and East 1050th Avenue where a two-story masonry building experienced failure to its top story walls.  The adjacent properties also experienced heavy damage where the exterior walls of two |single-family homes collapsed.  Damage to trees and utility poles in this area was extensive due to the amount of debris strewn toward the northeast. ||The tornado then moved over Robinson Municipal Airport, destroying airport hangers and a small outbuilding.  The progressive collapse of the rigid frames of the metal building systems, which included steel beams measuring greater than 18 inches in diameter, caused the survey team to estimate EF3 damage at this point.||A continuous track of EF1 damage then extended northeastward across County Highway 5 where multiple single-family homes exhibited large sections of their roof structures removed.  In addition, multiple large machine sheds experienced a collapse of their wall structures. ||The survey team concluded that the storm likely maintained its intensity as it tracked northeastward toward the Wabash River, noting about a quarter-mile wide swath of heavy tree damage to distant tree lines as it continued toward the river.  The tornado then crossed the Wabash River into the National Weather Service Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) in western Sullivan County at 9:21pm CDT.","Two rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms spawned 13 tornadoes across central Illinois during the afternoon and evening of March 31st...including an EF-3 tornado that killed 3 people in Robinson in Crawford County.  The first round of convection developed along a warm front lifting northeastward through the area during the afternoon.  These storms were primarily very large hail-producers, with up to baseball-sized (2.75 diameter) hail being reported in the town of Banner in Fulton County.  Once the warm front lifted into northern Illinois, a modestly unstable but highly sheared environment was in place during the late afternoon and evening...with CAPE values of 1500-2500J/kg and 0-6km bulk shear in excess of 70kt.  As a trailing cold front approached from the west, additional supercell thunderstorms developed that produced tornadoes, very large hail, and damaging wind gusts.  The cells eventually congealed into a broken line as they pushed eastward to the I-57 corridor by mid-evening.  Meanwhile, a discrete supercell ahead of the line tracked south of I-70, dropping the EF-3 tornado in Crawford County.",91

The tornado crossed the Wabash River, entering Sullivan County 1.8 miles south of Merom.  Near Merom, the tornado severely damaged 3 homes and destroyed a modular home which was thrown at least 200 yards to destruction.  Two occupants of this home were killed.  Also, a large trailer and several cars were thrown tens of yards from their resting location.  The violent winds sheared off trees approximately 20 to 30 feet above ground.||The tornado continued across southern portions of the City of Sullivan. Dozens of homes and structures were severely damaged or destroyed, indicating the strongest winds of the tornado's entire 41-mile track that peaked near 165 mph.  The tornado continued to locations immediately south-southeast, and then southeast of Sullivan, destroying at least 3 additional homes, including a modular home which was thrown at least 150 yards.  One occupant of this home was killed, while the other was injured.   Many trees were again sheared 20 to 30 feet off the ground.  Continuing to the east-northeast, the circulation began to weaken as it continued into a wooded area, damaging numerous trees before lifting off the ground 3.3 miles east of Sullivan.  Much damage in the area reached EF2-intensity (111-135 mph winds), with several locations where winds reached the EF3-intensity (136-165 mph winds).","A strong, occluding storm system over the Upper Midwest produced a deep column of strong southwesterly winds over the Midwest on the afternoon and evening of the 31st.|This pattern generated an inordinate amount of vertical wind shear.
