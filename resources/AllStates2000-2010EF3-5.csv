				Tarrant County Thunderstorm Narrative
				

The first tornado damage was reported near Castleberry High School, about four miles west of downtown Fort Worth (618 PM). Additional roof and tree damage occurred in Monticello neighborhood of River Oaks. A number of businesses were then damaged or destroyed near the intersection of Camp Bowie and West Seventh (620 PM). Tornado moved east along West Seventh Street, striking the Montgomery Ward building and the adjacent Linwood neighborhood, doing extensive damage to older homes (622 PM). The tornado then did extensive damage to the six story Cash America building, nearly destroying it. Further significant damage was then done to the Mallick Tower building and Calvary Cathedral Building (624 PM). The tornado weakened as it entered downtown, but wind borne debris broke thousands of windows in buildings and high rises (626 PM). Particularly hard hit was the Bank One Building, which had 80% (3,000) of its windows broken, and the Union Pacific Resources Building (1,300 of 5,000 windows broken). Numerous other structures were affected to a lesser degree. Automobiles in streets and parking lots were also damaged. The tornado then dissipated as it moved east of downtown, although scattered minor damage occurred to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards about 3 miles east of the city near I-30 and Brentwood Stair. 

	Two people were killed as a direct result of the tornado. A man (age 52) was killed while trying to reach shelter after warning others of the tornado, while a homeless man (age 67) was killed by a wall that collapsed on him. Some 80 other people were injured, but only six required hospitalization. Hail did extensive damage to roofs and autos mainly in Lake Worth and Saginaw. 

	Initial tornado damage in Arlington occurred at a restaurant on South Cooper street. The tornado moved east and gained strength, doing F3 damage near Bardin and Matlock (707 PM), south of I-20. The tornado then struck the northern part of Arlington Airport (F2). The tornado paralled I-20, crossing the Interstate about one mile west of Highway 360, overturning at least one 18-wheeler (F1)(712 PM). The tornado then began moving northeast, ending with F2 damage to subdivision just northeast of Grand Prairie airport (near Arkansas and Parkside)(720 PM). In spite of the damage, there were no deaths or serious injuries in Arlington or Grand Prairie.

	One commercial building was destroyed in Arlington, and 22 others damaged. Residential building damage (Tarrant county) was as follows:

A big day for severe weather across northwest portions of the area.  Several outflow boundaries, a dryline, and moist unstable air all helped contribute to thunderstorm development.  There were several rounds of thunderstorms, the first wave was in the early morning hours, from about 3 am to 5 am. This activity developed in Young and Palo Pinto counties and moved eastward to affect Parker, Jack, Wise and Tarrant counties.  

Another event developed in the early evening, generally north and west of a Dallas, Glen Rose, Eastland line.  Most of the activity was centered on Young, Jack, and Stephens county.  A large tornado occurred near Olney (Young County) during this event. A continuation of aa tornado that began in Throckmorton county.",19,,,

During the day, very strong warm air advection took place.  Temperatures warmed rapidly  during the day with highs reaching the mid to upper 90s over about the southwest half of the state.  Dew point temperatures were in the upper 60s to low 70s.  This combination produced CAPE values in excess of 8000 J/kg.  During the afternoon, a strong cap was in place with 700 mb temperatures around +16 C.  This prevented convection from firing during the afternoon.  Toward evening, thunderstorms broke through the cap over northeast Iowa.  The storms went from initial echo to tornadic storms in less than 50 minutes.  A supercell formed west of the Waterloo area.  This cell became a splitting cell and produced a brief tornado in Grundy County as the right moving cell split off, and golf ball size hail in Bremer County from the left moving cell.  The cell moved off quickly, however additional supercells back developed over the same area.  the strongest tornado developed in the Cedar Falls area and tracked across the northern portions of Waterloo.  This cell produced a strong tornado which was actually a multi-vortex tornado based on reports from storm chasers in the area.  At one point, west of Dunkerton, three tornadoes each one quarter mile wide were on the ground with this storm.  The tornado damaged several houses and a few farmsteads along the way.  Reports indicated between 5 and 10 houses in Black Hawk County were totally destroyed, and another 15 to 20 sustained significant damage.  A total of at least 41 structures sustained at least some damage.  In addition to the tornado, damage also occurred south of the track as RFD winds estimated as high as 100 MPH were observed.  Dunkerton was hard hit as the tornado moved through.  Heavy damage was reported at a coop elevator in Dunkerton, with 10 of 16 grain elevators damaged.  A roof was removed from a church as well, resulting in about $500,000 damage.  The City Hall building was destroyed in Dunkerton.  The City Hall was housed in a series of double wide trailers since ironically the former City Hall building was destroyed just last year in the floods of '99.  As the tornado moved through the fairly densely populated area, numerous injuries were reported.  Some of the injuries were severe with limbs being cut off by flying debris.  One woman lost both one arm and one hand, and had her back broken.  She passed away 17 days after her injuries occurred.  Six of the injuries occurred at a nursing home that was hit by the tornado.  They occurred as the 139 residents were being evacuated.  Reports indicated the width of the tornado was up to three-quarters of a mile at its widest.  The damage path from the storm was around one and one half miles wide.  The tornado continued moving east and crossed into Buchanan County, about 4 miles northeast of Dunkerton.  A short time later, another cell developed in the Dunkerton area and dropped a tornado.  That tornado struck a farm northwest of town, destroying the farm house and seven outbuildings.  In addition to the damage that occurred to the structures, the family dog and one of the five horses on the farm were killed.  Reports indicate a letter from one of the farm houses destroyed was found 60 miles away from Dunkerton in the town of Monona in Clayton County.  Polly Mill's rural Dunkerton farmhouse was shredded by the tornado.  She lost some of her late husband's military medals, pages out of the family Bible, and part of her collection of letters and first-issue stamps.  Sixty miles away, on a farm east of Monona, the letter was found in an envelope carrying a first-day issue, 5-cent stamp commemorating the Battle of New Orleans.  There was yet a third round of tornadic storms in the Dunkerton area.  The last tornado touched down near Dunkerton and developed southward.  Two houses in the town of Dunkerton were destroyed by this tornado.  In addition to the tornadoes, very heavy rain fell in a narrow area of Black Hawk County.  Reports of 3 inches or more of rain was received from the area.  Soil conditions were very dry at the time.  The dry soil conditions helped preclude any significant flooding.  By the afternoon of the 12th, Iowa Governor Vilsack had declared Black Hawk County a state disaster area.",20,,,

Traveling in a northeasterly direction the tornado moved from a rural, unpopulated area of the Black Warrior River into an area of homes south of Shelton State Community College. The tornado crossed SR 69 destroying a nearly complete shopping center which included a Winn Dixie store. East of SR 69 the tornado destroyed a number of houses and residential structures. 

As the tornado reached US 82 it destroyed a number of mobile homes where several deaths were reported. From US 82 the tornado continued northeasterly downing numerous trees and power lines and damaging residential structures. The tornado crossed I-20/59 just west of exit 77 where many trees were uprooted or snapped off. Minor damage occurred to the JVC manufacturing facility. 

At exit 77 a number of commercial structures including hotels, fast food restaurants, and truck stops sustained damage including a number of vehicles that were overturned. The tornado continued northeasterly for a couple of miles before dissipating rapidly. Ironically, the tornado dissipated as it moved into an open, unpopulated area. 

The tornado was spawned by a supercell thunderstorm that originated in Mississippi. This thunderstorm was responsible for additional tornado damage in St. Clair and Etowah counties.

Tuscaloosa EMA reported 11 fatalities with this tornado along with 144 injuries. Nine of the fatalities occurred in mobile homes, one in a vehicle, and one in a commercial building converted to residential use. Six of those killed were females and five were males. Ages ranged from 16 months to 83 years old.  There were 251 single family dwellings affected (43 destroyed, 76 with major damage, 138 with minor damage), 179 mobile homes affected (79 destroyed,  23 with major damage, 77 with minor damage), and 13 businesses affected (1 destroyed, 7 with major damage, 5 with minor damage).

The tornado was on the ground for a total of 18 miles, all within Tuscaloosa County. The tornado path was estimated to be 750 yards wide at it's maximum intensity. 

This tornado was rated an F4 on the Fujita Scale for tornado intensity. Tornado intensity varied along the path with considerable F2 and F3 damage in the area from just west of SR 69 to US 82 in the Hinton Place and Hillcrest Meadows areas as well as the Bear Creek area. It was also in these areas where pockets of F4 destruction occurred. 

The tornado first touched down at 12:54 PM and dissipated at 1:12 PM with a forward speed of approximately 60 MPH.

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come off the mountain"" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path", so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  ,,,

Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately," no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado ""dropped onto it"".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next", it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One thunderstorm produced a devastating F3 tornado which was on the ground for 17.5 miles from College Park in Prince George's County to just east of Columbia in Howard County.  Multiple vortices were reported with the tornado at times.  The tornado first touched down in Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park just west of Hyattsville.  It rapidly strengthened to an F3 tornado with winds up to 200 MPH.  The damage path ranged in width from 100 to 200 yards.  The tornado crossed the intersection of Adelphi Road and University Boulevard into the western campus of the University of Maryland.  Ten trailers being used as a temporary office for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute were completely destroyed by the twister.  Debris from the trailers such as video tapes and pieces of paper were found up to 60 miles away in Northern Baltimore and Harford Counties in addition to extreme southeast Pennsylvania.  Four of the six people inside the trailers were injured, one seriously.  One staff member was thrown free of the destruction and was found in a dumpster nearby.  Another person dug their hands into the carpet and held on as their feet were being pulled up in the air by the tornado.  The other four occupants, including one child, took shelter under desks and survived.  Two University of Maryland students who were visiting their father who worked in the trailers left by car shortly before the tornado hit.  The two sisters, ages 20 and 23, were killed when the tornado picked up their car outside of Denton Hall and threw it either around or over an eight-story dorm.  They died instantly when their car crashed into a wooded area 300 yards from the road.  

Most of the other buildings on the campus in the path of the storm were made of brick and suffered only minor to moderate damage, such as Denton Hall Dormitory, Easton Hall Dormitory and Dining Hall, and the President's Mansion.  A parking lot outside of Denton Hall full of cars was also hit by the tornado.

The tornado moved north-northeast off the campus and crossed University Boulevard at the intersection of Metzerott Road.  The steeple of a church was removed and cars were flipped near the intersection.  Power lines and trees were also downed.  The twister continued through Paint Branch Stream Valley Park where it downed numerous trees.   The tornado weakened to F2 strength before it crossed Interstate 95/495 just west of the Route 1 interchange.  It was remarkable that even though the highway was filled with bumper to bumper rush hour traffic, the only damage reported was a flipped tractor trailer.  The next area hit by the tornado was the community of Cherry Hill.  Several trees and power lines were downed onto roads and houses just west of Baltimore Avenue, including the Chestnut Hills subdivision.

This tornado developed on the southwest side of Cordell, where a mobile home and metal warehouse were blown into a farmhouse. The tornado then moved through south, east and northeast portions of Cordell, including a business district and a large residential area. Most damage south of Main Street was rated F0 or F1. North of Main Street, the damage path widened to approximately 500 yards, with the tornado then inflicting widespread F1 to F2 damage up to 12th Street. Hundreds of homes were damaged in this area. As the tornado began to exit the northeast side of Cordell, F3 damage was sustained to several homes on 9th Street, just west of Crider Road. An F4 rating was considered; however, the structural integrity of most structures was at or below average, and was taken into consideration. Another interesting note is that several eye-witnesses reported that the tornado was widest and contained the most violent-looking winds at this time. The tornado eventually exited Cordell and dissipated 3.5 miles northeast of town. The Oklahoma State Emergency Management Office estimated that 477 single-family homes were damaged, 132 considered uninhabitable. In addition, 40 businesses were damaged, 22 considered uninhabitable.

As many as nine tornadoes were confirmed and many reports of hail were received.

The tornado damage was confined to an area located north and east of Grand Island, which included Merrick, Nance, Polk, Greeley, and Hamilton counties.  The tornadoes got going west of Marquette.  One twister set down in Hamilton county and crossed the Platte River southeast of Chapman.  Damage to outbuildings was of most significance.  Other tornadoes were reported in the Marquette area, with one tornado on the ground for 12 miles from south of Marquette to southeast of Hordville.  This tornado was rated an F1 and produced minor structural damage to buildings and grain bins at several farms.  Power lines were lost and several trees were blown over.  Numerous center pivot irrigation systems were damaged.

Just before 6 pm CDT, the most damaging tornado of the day developed near the Polk and Hamilton county line, and proceeded northeast across western Polk county, leaving a path of destruction in its wake.  Storm chaser reports indicated this tornado frequently became multi-vortex in nature and produced a wide swath of damage.  Three miles north of Polk, a home was completely ripped from its foundation and blown into some nearby trees.  The tornado was rated an F3 at this point.  Along its 18 mile path, the tornado damaged over 20 center pivots, and nearly every farmstead in the path of the tornado sustained damage to the home, outbuildings, machinery or grain bins.  This tornado lifted southwest of Silver Creek.

Just prior to the F3 tornado in Polk county, an F2 tornado was ripping up a farmstead in northern Merrick county.  This tornado was responsible for tearing the roof from a home, destroying two large metal outbuildings and damage to a half-dozen vehicles.  The tornado moved north and destroyed a barn on the Nance and Merrick county line, but narrowly missed the home.  Window and siding damage was noted at the home.

Later that evening, one final tornado was reported.  This tornado moved from south of Silver Creek to northeast of Silver Creek just before sunset.  The tornado clipped the southeast side of town, resulting in damage to the post office, several cars, trees, and 13 residences in town.  Fortunately, most of the damage was minor.",53,,,

The tornado entered Cullman County at 9:08 pm, moving across portions of Smith Lake and across CR 222. Tornado intensity remained high during the first several miles after it entered Cullman County. Continuing northeast, it crossed Interstate 65 and US 31 just south of Cullman on the southside of the Cullman Golf Course.

The tornado seemed to be significantly less intense as it continued to travel northeasterly toward Holly Pond. Damage from just east of US 31 to just south of Holly Pond was not nearly as intense as it was west of Interstate 65. Traveling through mostly rural areas downing trees and powerlines, and damaging scattered structures along the way, the tornado finally ended just south-southeast of Holly Pond at 9:52 pm, 

This was the longest tornado of the outbreak, with a path length of 72.6 miles and a width of 1100 yards. It was the second F3 tornado of the day. Seven deaths were reported with the storm, all in Walker County, along with an estimated 45 injuries.

Structural damage details are difficult to report since reporting is based primarily on county and not by individual tornadoes.  Based on EMA and Red Cross data, structures damaged or destroyed were approximately 20 in Fayette County, 300 in Walker County, 5 in Winston County, and 164 in Cullman County.

This is also one of the longest tornadoes tracks in recent history. At 72.6 miles in length, this becomes the fourth longest tornado in Alabama since 1950.

A commercial building on the south side of 12th suffered F3 damage, as did several homes on the north side of 12th Street at City Avenue where several homes lost most of their outside walls. Maximum damage intensity on Sunrise Avenue (north of 12th and one block east of City Ave.) was rated strong F2 and consisted mostly of homes being partially or totally unroofed. Several vehicles were tossed into front yards, and in one case nearly into the front of a home.

The worst damage produced within the city of Moore was as the tornado approached west sides of Interstate 35, just north of 12th Street. Damage in this area included major damage to two hotels, the First Christian Church, the Young Child Development Center, a Project Headstart building, an office building, and several restaurants. The church, child care center, and office building were leveled. The two hotels, both two-story, had their second floors partially or totally removed by the tornado. At least a half dozen vehicles were tossed in this area, with evidence suggesting that some of them may have traveled 100 yards or more. Had the leveled buildings here shown evidence of better construction, damage might have been rated F4. As it was, damage here was rated strong F3.

A southbound moving Greyhound bus was hit by the tornado as it crossed Interstate 35. The bus was carrying twenty-three passengers, some of which chose to disembark to take cover in a ditch while others chose to stay on the bus. The bus rolled several times jostling passengers around the interior. Passengers were trapped between crushed seats and buckled walls while others were left hanging upside down and out broken windows. Of those that hid in the ditch, eleven were injured by flying debris. Eight passengers that stayed on the bus were also injured. Most of the injuries to the passengers were minor.

The tornado crossed Interstate 35 0.25 to 0.50 miles north of 12th Street, damaging or destroying several businesses along Broadway, just east of the interstate. Intensity dropped to F2 in this area, but the path width remained close to a quarter of a mile. The tornado continued northeast across south and east parts of the Highland Park residential area, causing F1 and spotty F2 damage. The tornado weakened to F1 intensity and turned slightly to the north-northeast as it crossed Pole Road and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks near and just south of Northeast 27th Street.

It should be noted that the damage track of this tornado through Moore was nearly parallel to, and generally a quarter of a mile or less south of, the track of the F5 tornado that struck Moore on 3 May 1999. In fact, Highland Park also suffered extensive damage from the May 3rd tornado, but that damage was mainly in the north and west parts of the area. The damage track through Highland Park on 8 May 2003 was roughly two blocks farther south.

The tornado crossed Northeast 27th between Pole Road and Eastern Avenue and continued northeast, crossing Eastern at the Lakeside Golf Course, just east of Eastern and straddling the Oklahoma City and Moore city limits. This golf course also took a direct hit from the tornado on 3 May 1999, and from this point northeastward for about one mile, the two tornado tracks overlapped. The tornado, at this point F1, continued northeast from the golf course into an open field just south of Southeast 89th Street, then struck the northwest part of a subdivision just south of 89th Street and west of Bryant Avenue. More than a dozen residences, including duplexes and single-family homes, were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area. The same northwest part of this subdivision was hit hard on 3 May 1999; many of the homes damaged or destroyed on 8 May had been rebuilt and were less than four years old.

This tornado continued into Oklahoma County becoming an F4 and traveling a total of 17.3 miles.","Two tornadic supercells produced four tornadoes during the afternoon hours of May 8, 2003. One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data).

The western edge of the damage path along SE 89th Street was about halfway between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue and the eastern edge of the damage path was just east of Bryant Avenue. As the tornado approached Sunnylane Road, it produced significant damage to a manufacturing and distribution plant just west of Sunnylane along Southeast 85th Street. Six people were in the plant when the tornado struck, but were able to seek shelter in a safe room and nobody was injured at the plant. The manufacturing part of the complex was a large, free-span structure that was destroyed. The adjoining office part of the complex to the south was a brick structure that received significant damage to the exterior walls. To the east of the plant along the east side of Sunnylane Road, a car was flipped over. Between Sunnylane Road and Sooner Road, the tornado traveled through an open area narrowly missing a residential area. But as it crossed Sooner Road, it damaged or destroyed a number of businesses including a convenience store and a bank to the south of Interstate 240.

The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Interstate 240 and Southeast 74th Street. Along SE 74th, a number of businesses received significant damage including a storage facility, a boat dealership, a Mary Kay Training Center, and a trucking company.

Crossing Air Depot Boulevard, the tornado moved onto the property of the General Motors Corporation Assembly Plant causing significant (F4) damage to the plant. A newly built paint shop sustained the heaviest damage exposing equipment and new production parts to the weather. The body shop, power house, and a couple of cooling tanks also sustained significant damage. The stack of one of the boilers was also sheared off. More than 600 newly assembled sport utility vehicles parked outside the plant were damaged or destroyed. Approximately 100 employee vehicles were also damaged with one compact car being flipped vertically and wedged into the side of the paint shop. Two truck drivers making deliveries to the plant sustained minor injuries. However, the more than one thousand plant employees remained uninjured by moving to shelter well before the tornado struck. The nearby United Auto Workers Union headquarters was also heavily damaged in this area.

The tornado moved into the southeast section of Tinker Air Force Base, including the south part of the runway complex. An ammunition storage bunker and a guard shack at the gate near Southeast 59th Street and Douglas Boulevard were heavily damaged. The guards and other personnel were able to seek shelter in an underground shelter. After crossing Douglas Boulevard, the tornado continued to slowly veer to the northeast and damaged homes along Berryman Road. The tornado continued to damage homes and downing trees and power lines. Strong F2 to F3 damage was observed on the west side of Post Road to the south of Southeast 44th Street.

A number of homes were significantly damaged or destroyed in the north part of the Kennington neighborhood, which is located southeast of Southeast 44th Street and Post Road. Two homes in the north part of the neighborhood were completely destroyed consistent with F4 damage. One of these was a two story home with no roof or walls remaining. Two cars from the garage of a residence on the west side of Kennington Lane were found about 50 yards to the east. Another home farther east was destroyed, although walls remained intact. Other homes were severely damaged. The tornado continued across SE 44th Street and Interstate 40 and went into a residential area just west of Westminister Road. Homes were damaged on Newey Avenue, Randy Street, and Rowlett Avenue with the most significant damage near the intersection of Randy Street and Rowlett Avenue where house damage consistent with an F3 rating was observed. The tornado was likely a multiple-vortex tornado in this area as some of the damage in this area was inconsistent with a single cyclonic rotation.

The tornado crossed Westminister Road and damaged more homes along Burning Oaks Drive. F3 damage occurred to a few homes along Burning Oaks Drive between Westminister and Twisted Oaks Drive. To the northeast, homes in another residential area on Southeast 32nd Street were significantly damaged and a number of large trees were also downed. Damage continued to the northeast crossing Anderson Road and Southeast 29th Street moving into the city of Midwest City. There were no known structures to hit as the tornado traveled northeast from near SE 29th and Anderson Road to Hiwassee Road. Significant tree damage was observed and one structure was damaged (F1) along Hiwassee Road just to the south of Southeast 15th Street. A large number of power poles and large trees were downed along SE 15th Street to the east of Hiwassee.

To the north of Southeast 15th Street, the tornado moved into the Hidden Valley"" residential area of the city of Choctaw. The only known injury in Choctaw occurred where a woman suffered a broken leg as one home on Hidden Valley Lane was destroyed (F4). Two homes under construction were also destroyed. The tornado was narrower in this area. Other homes in the neighborhood were damaged along Willow Drive", Hummingbird Drive, and Kingbird Drive. In eastern portions of the neighborhood, significant tree damage continued, although there was no significant structural damage. The tornado turned more to the east-northeast again and crossed Henney Road and approached Choctaw Road near Southeast 10th Street where more homes were damaged. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast and dissipated southwest of Indian Meridian Road and Reno Avenue.,

In a field not far from Little Chief seven cattle were killed.  Along Highway 60 to the northeast of Little Chief a house and garage were completely swept from their foundation.  At the same location a barn was destroyed and three horses were killed.  Further to the northeast as the tornado entered the Tall Grass Prairie Preserve, it produced additional significant tree damage. Throughout the path of the tornado up to 30 power poles were blown down causing power outages across a significant part of Osage county. The F3 damage was classified at two locations: the first was near where the cattle were killed--this was the only location that showed the scouring of grasses along the path; the second location was in the western sections of the Tall Grass Prairie Reserve where an Oak Forest was heavily damaged.  Although the one house was swept off its foundation, it was clear that this house's anchoring failed prematurely.

As the tornado moved northeast to Interstate 35, the width of the damage consistently was a third of a mile wide, and the maximum damage was F1 with widespread tree damage, snapped power poles, and roof damage to a number of homes south of Britton Road. The damage intensified to F2 on the west side of Interstate 35 where the roof was taken off of one wing of the Clara Waters Community Corrections Center. South of East Hefner Road and east of Interstate 35, an industrial building at a horse ranching operation sustained F3 damage. At that location, the steel frame, fastened to the concrete foundation with four one-inch diameter steel rods, was destroyed and steel reinforced concrete was pulled out of the ground. The tornado next produced F2 damage to the front portion of the Oakdale School at North Sooner Road and East Hefner Road. The Witcher Baptist Church, just south of the school, sustained F1 damage. East of Sooner Road and north of Hefner Road, the tornado weakened, producing F1 damage on the southeast side of the River Oaks Golf Club/Community. South of Northeast 122nd Street, between North Air Depot Boulevard and North Midwest Boulevard, the tornado strengthened again and the path widened to over three-quarters of a mile wide as the tornado turned more to the northeast. South of Northeast 122nd, between Midwest Boulevard and Douglas Boulevard, significant damage occurred to homes and trees. One home was completely destroyed (F3), two homes were heavily damaged (F2), and a vehicle was tossed 25 yards. 

The tornado turned to the southeast and damage weakened to F1 approximately 0.3 miles west of the intersection of North Post Road and Hefner Road. The tornado then turned back east-northeast causing a sheet metal hay barn to be completely blown down with hay intact. Several poles were downed towards the north, 0.25 miles west of the barn. Partial barn roof removal was found southwest of location in an open field. Another area of F1 damage began 0.3 miles north of the intersection of North 108th Street and Westminster Boulevard. A metal roof was peeled off and several tree limbs downed in this location. The tornado intensified to F2 just shortly after this, downing high tension poles 0.5 miles north of the intersection of Anderson Road and 108th Street. A farm just to the west of this location had a roof missing. The roof slid off the garage to the east. Large barn on west side lost west end of roof with debris inside. Northeast wall section of barn was essentially undamaged. A house also had shingle damage and broken windows. To the north of the farm, trees were damaged and poles were snapped.

The tornado continued northeast causing the metal roof of a building, located 0.4 miles south of the intersection of Hiwassee Road and Memorial Road (North 136th Street), to peel off and be thrown 30 yards to the south. Tree damage was also found south of this location. A farm was damaged 0.8 miles south of the intersection. A barn was heavily damaged with debris thrown to the north. A pecan fork was also downed. There was also shingle damage just south of the barn. The tornado then caused damage to an outbuilding at the corner of Northeast 122nd Street and Henney Road. In an area just west of the intersection of Choctaw Road and Memorial Road, the northwest part of the roof of a house located on Spruce Valley Drive was removed, along with removing the roof of a mobile home located on Cedar Bend Road.

As the tornado continued northeast, it uprooted trees and downed tree limbs. Shortly before the tornado dissipated, a mobile home rolled off of cinder blocks, but was otherwise undamaged. The tornado did some more minor tree damage before dissipating.

The tornado first moved northeast causing a damage path which was located from 6.9 miles south of Edmond to 4.8 miles northwest of Jones. The tornado then turned southeast with a path from 4.8 miles northwest of Jones to 3.9 miles west-northwest of Jones. After the tornado turned back to the northeast, the path extended from 3.9 miles west-northwest of Jones to 2.8 miles south of Luther.

From there the tornado crossed into Saline county southwest of Western and remained an f0 or f1 until it struck the southern portion of Wilber where it strengthened to f2. Roofs were blown off of homes just southeast of Wilber.

The tornado traveled from Wilber into Gage county, crossing the county line west of Clatonia where it grew to its most intense stage, f4.  The tornado remained nearly at this strength as it crossed into Lancaster county near Hallam with a damage path of around 2 1/2 miles.

It tracked north, primarily in open fields, and lifted between 350th and 360th Street east of New Haven, or just west of Windfall Avenue.  The tornado was rated an F1.

The second tornado touched down just east of the Mitchell-Howard County line, about 4 miles south of Riceville (Howard County), and also moved straight north.  It downed a few trees, but primarily crossed open fields until it reached the southeast side of Riceville.  It damaged a few sheds and buildings in Riceville, with mainly tin roofing material and siding blown off.  The tornado lifted in Riceville and was rated an F0.

The third and most significant tornado formed about 2 miles north of Riceville, again just east of the Mitchell-Howard County line.  The tornado tracked north, just east of the county line or Addison Avenue.  It grew in strength and at one point was approximately 150 yards wide, hitting several homes and farms (F2 damage).  One home lost the roof and all buildings.  The tornado was so close to the county line that debris was thrown across Addison Avenue into Mitchell County at times.  The dirt and young crops were scoured by the tornado.  The tornado crossed into Minnesota just southwest of Le Roy (Mower County), hitting a home directly on the state line.

It continued east-southeast to the southern edge of Lake Kegonsa and tore through residential neighborhoods about 1/3 to 1/2 mile north of CTH B (Civil Towns of Dunn and Pleasant Springs, and far-northern Stoughton).  It moved over the crossing of CTH A with Interstate 90/39, and stayed close to CTH A to its exit point at 1905CST where CTH A crosses into Jefferson County, about 2.8 miles south-southwest of Rockdale.  One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor.  Twenty-three (23) other people were directly injured.  In addition, Emergency Management officials received reports of 2 other indirectly-related deaths associated with this strong tornado.  In these two cases, the people were already very ill or suffering from a life-ending  disease.  Injuries they received during the tornado contributed (secondary) to their death, but were not the primary cause of death, based on medical examiner reports.  Consequently, these additional two deaths do not appear in the official death tally in the header strip of this event.  Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton.

As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed.  Total estimated damage amounts (directly-related) for private and public sectors combined was $35.06 M, broken down to $34.31 M in property damage and $750 K in crop losses, for the tornado segment in Dane County.  This tornado was probably the 3rd most costly tornado in Wisconsin's recorded history (1996 Oakfield tornado and 1984 Barneveld tornadoes were more costly). The $34.31 M in property damage was broken down to private losses (total of 32.29 M) and public losses (total of $2.02 M), per Emergency Manager reports and NWS estimates.  The private losses included a total of $25.45 M for residential structures, $1.29 M for businesses, $4.25 M for agricultural structures, $1.00 M for damage to vehicles, boats, and other personal effects, $200 K to agricultural machinery and tools, and $96 K in public road system damage.  The public losses making up part of the $34.31 M consisted of $2.02 M in damage to public utility systems.  The $750 K in damage attributed to crop losses occurred on an estimated 1,550 acres of land.  Additional monetary costs incurred in the public sector (totaling $1.84 M) which are considered indirectly-related damage expenses, and not included in the direct"" totals listed in the header-strip of this event", include: $1.38 M in debris clearance, $308 K in protective measures, and miscellaneous damage/expenses of $144 K.

Just south of the tornado, extending out another mile or so, tree and power-line damage resulted from rear-flank downdraft damage - in some cases south to STH 51.  This damage is separate from tornado damage, and isn't included in the numbers in previous sentences.  Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent's updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha.  This tornado was extensively photographed and video-taped by storm spotters (amateur radio operators, etc.), storm chasers, and private citizens.  On occasions, this tornado displayed multiple-vortex characteristics.  Due to partial back-building (to the west-southwest) of the supercell's updraft tower, this tornado moved slowly, and was described by some eyewitnesses and spotters as being nearly stationary at times north of Stoughton.  The overall slow movement (supercell moved at 12-17 knots, or 10-15 mph), coupled with structures that were not thoroughly reinforced (based on NWS damage survey), allowed the tornado's cyclonic winds to more severely damage buildings in its path.  Consequently, although some of the worst damage resembled what would be left by a F4 tornado for well-built homes," this tornado was rated at the top of the F3 category with estimated winds near 174 knots (200 mph).  The F3 category has estimated wind speeds of 137-179 knots (158-206 mph).  A sampling of newspaper headlines and personal quotes included: ""The Sky Just Exploded",  Hard to Believe There Weren't More Deaths, New Technology Lowers Tornado Deaths,  Counting Losses, Blessings, It Was Probably The Most Intense Storm In The Country This Year, It's a Mess Out Here," and I've Never Experienced Anything Like This.""  The tornado cut electrical power for 1700 customers in the Stoughton area.  The estimated average path length was about 175 yards.""","The largest single-day tornado outbreak in Wisconsin recorded history for south-central and southeast Wisconsin occurred on August 18, 2005.  Sixteen tornadoes were documented on this day in south-central and southeast Wisconsin, a new single-day record.  A line of supercells developed and pushed across south-central Wisconsin during the afternoon hours, and then pushed east across southeast Wisconsin during the evening hours.   Most of the tornadoes were associated with two supercells.  One main supercell tracked across Sauk County and then into Columbia, producing one F0 and one F2 tornado.  The F2 tornado crossed into Columbia County.  Another main supercell produced an F3 tornado that devastated the area north of city of Stoughton (Dane Co.), and a weaker F1 tornado just south of the city of Rockdale (Dane Co.).  This supercell then tracked into southwestern Jefferson County a short time later, producing two F0 tornadoes and four F1 tornadoes.  The sixteen (16) tornadoes contributed largely to both the new state record of 27 tornadoes on a single day, and 62 tornadoes for a calendar year.  In additiion, there were scattered reports of funnel clouds, damaging straight-line, downburst winds, and large hail across south-central and southeast Wisconsin.  The total direct damage estimate for the afternoon and evening tornado and severe weather outbreak in south-central and southeast Wisconsin on August 18th was about $36.6 M ($35.7 property and $948 K crop).  Additional indirect costs totaled almost $1.9 M, resulting in a total direct and direct cost of about $38.5 M. 

Synoptically, a surface low pressure system was located over extreme southeast Minnesota early in the afternoon.  A warm front extended east southeast from the low with dew points pooling in the lower 70s along it.  The surface low moved east into east central Wisconsin by 2100CST that evening.  Favorable wind shear associated with the warm front, combined with the strong instability supplied by the heat and humidity, helped to produce numerous tornadic supercells.",211,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One woman was killed when her house collapsed.,"A very intense weather system developed over the central U.S. during the day on the 12th.  A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.

A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.

Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.

The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.

A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.

The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.

As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 
tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.

Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.

Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.

Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.

Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.

Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.

Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.

Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.

Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.

Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.

Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.  This tornado was ANTICYCLONIC in nature.",219,,,

Reports from west of the Rio Grande indicate that a large and devastating tornado stuck Piedras Negras from the west, then dissipated on the west side of the Rio Grande.  The supercell crossed the Rio Grande near 6:00 pm CST and struck the community of Rosita Valley near 6:01pm CST. Severe outflow winds from the storm estimated at between 80 mph and 100 mph struck the community first, causing minor damage to houses and mobile homes. Roofs were partially lifted, exteriors of homes were damaged, and trees were knocked over. Following the wind damage, hail to the size of golfballs struck the area, along with very heavy rain.|Following the winds and hail, the tornado struck next. The team found the tornado touchdown point approximately one-quarter mile to the southwest of the Rosita Valley Elementary School. It struck a four room home��� destroying the outer walls and leaving only the interior walls standing. This damage was rated as EF-2 damage. The tornado then moved toward the east-northeast, directly toward the school. Along its path it damaged three more homes and destroyed a fourth. Damage to the three homes was rated EF-1 with the destroyed home rated EF-2. The tornado next struck a mobile home, tearing off its frame and tossing the debris into the school building. This also indicated EF-2 damage.  Then the tornado crossed Rosita Valley Road, destroying mobile homes and damaging homes and tossing the debris into the south and west sides of the Rosita Valley Elementary School building. The initial strike points at the school showed only minor EF-0 damage. However damage was severe from the center of the school northeastward. It appeared that the tornadic winds were able to open enough of the center part of the roof to enter the interior of the school. These winds as well as winds that entered through wall openings caused severe damage to the north and south wings of the building. This damage indicated wind speeds approaching 140 mph and damage at EF-3 level. To the northwest of the school were two brick retail buildings; both were well-constructed. Outer walls were destroyed in each with damage to interior walls in one of the structures. This also suggested wind speeds near 140 mph and EF-3 level damage.|Finally as the tornado exited the school area it struck an area of single family houses some 200 yards to the northeast. Most of the houses were swept off their foundations and many of them were completely flattened. This damage suggested wind speeds approaching 150 mph, the highest speeds found at Rosita Valley. This was mid-range EF-3 damage.  In conclusion���the tornado was rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale with a path width near one-quarter mile and a path length near four miles.  |In all the tornado destroyed one elementary school, along with 59 manufactured homes and 57 houses.  Major damage was reported to 21 manufactured homes and 19 houses with minor damage to10 manufactured homes, 22 houses, and 9 apartments.  There were seven deaths in Rosita Valley as a result of the tornado.  A family of five in one mobile home were killed as it was destroyed and rolled into the Rosita Valley Elementary School.  Two other victims were found, one in a permanent home that had collapsed and one in another mobile home.",A supercell thunderstorm produced one of the strongest and deadliest tornadoes to strike near the Rio Grande in many decades.,291,,,

Next, a shed was damaged and a combine harvester that was in the shed was thrown into some trees. After moving through a wooded area, the tornado moved into a neighborhood with new, well-built homes. Around 8 homes were damaged in this neighborhood, with around 5 of them being severely damaged. Roofs were ripped off, walls were collapsed, and a few were even moved off their foundations. The tornado moved through another wooded area and emerged into the Caledonia school complex. It was here that the tornado reached its maximum intensity.  The press box and concession stand of the football stadium were destroyed, several medal power poles were bent over, and several trees were knocked down. Numerous vehicles were moved along the ground up to 100 yards, some were flipped over, some had multiple dents from gravel in the parking lot, and numerous windows were broken out. Five school buses were damaged, two of which were flipped over, and one of which was lifted up and ripped apart with the chassis landing in one of the buildings and the frame landing on top of a building. The school gymnasium and a Vocational Tech Building were nearly destroyed with several vehicles including the bus landing inside it. The tornado then left the school complex and moved across the south side of Caledonia.  Around 6 homes experienced significant damage here, mainly to the roofs.  A church was completely destroyed when the roof was lifted up and collapsed on the building. Another church nearby had minor roof damage.  The tornado entered another wooded area causing damage to trees and then emerged along Caledonia-Vernon Road. The tornado moved along the road for several miles. Along this part of the path, numerous single family homes were severely damaged.  The roofs were ripped off and the walls were collapsed on several homes.  Numerous hard wood trees were snapped, several of which fell on cars and homes.   A horse stable was completely destroyed and a high tension medal truss tower was snapped.  Further along the road, several mobile homes were completely destroyed.  One in particular had the body of the trailer blown downwind and the frame was dragged back along the ground in the opposite direction for around 25 yards.  Several cars were moved for a distance around 50 yards at this location as well. The tornado then entered another wooded area causing some tree damage and then weakened before crossing the state line into Lamar County, Alabama. The total path length in Lowndes County was 8.7 miles with an EF3 Enhanced Fujita Scale rating. The total path length for the entire tornado, including each county, was 13.2 miles.||The school complex was occupied by over 2100 students and faculty at the time of the tornado.

Some Georgia Power high transmission towers were also down.","The pattern that began to evolve on March 14th continued and intensified on March 15th.  A stationary front remained draped across north Georgia from near Atlanta to Athens.  South of this front, the air mass was becoming increasingly warm, moist and unstable.  Meanwhile, aloft, a low amplitude, yet vigorous short wave embedded within a fast zonal flow, was tracking rapidly eastward from the mid south into the southeast.  Strong shear and high helicity combined with the unstable air mass and the frontal boundary to allow repeated severe thunderstorms to develop and track eastward along the boundary across north Georgia.  The activity began early in the day as a complex of thunderstorms moved into the area from Alabama and continued until nearly midnight.  As the day progressed, especially during the afternoon, the development of the activity gradually progressed further south and by midnight had reached the south and southeast parts of the state.  Numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadic supercells were observed throughout the day.||Historical records indicate that this was one of the most significant severe weather days for the Peachtree City Weather Forecast Office with more events and warnings than had been observed since May 2003.",348,,,

No one was in this building at the time of the Tornado because they were out on a non weather related call.||The Gateway Behavioral Health and Services Building was totally destroyed. This metal framed building with brick exterior was located about 100 yards east-northeast of the McIntosh Emergency Medical Services Building and 130 yards east-southeast of the Marine Sales and Services Building. The roof of the Gateway Building collapsed along with many of the outer brick walls. Many of the large load bearing metal beams were bent or knocked down. Portions of the metal roof were carried a mile away onto Interstate 95. Some of the roofing material was found 11 miles away on Sapelo Island. Of the 12 people that were in the building when the Tornado hit, 9 were injured sustaining broken bones and or lacerations. Six vehicles around this building were damaged or destroyed and a metal light pole and several trees were snapped off in this area. ||Two other businesses in this area suffered damage including damage to satellite dishes and two overturned tractor trailers. Damage to the Marine Sales and Services Business and the Gateway Behavioral Health and Services Building indicated that EF-4 damage had occurred with winds estimated to be between 170 and 180 mph. ||After leaving this area the Tornado traveled east and weakened. The Tornado reached its maximum width of 700 yards as it crossed Interstate 95, and then decreased in size and was mainly from 200 to 500 yards wide during the remainder of the path. The Tornado damaged or destroyed four billboards along Interstate 95, produced mainly minor roof damage to several dozen homes mainly in the Ridgeville area, snapped off or uprooted thousands of trees, some of them falling on homes or vehicles, and damaged or destroyed numerous outbuildings. ||A resident of Ridgeville, Georgia whose home suffered minor damage in the Tornado, took shelter in a closet after seeing a National Weather Service Severe Weather Statement on the television mentioning that Ridgeville was in the path of the Tornado. ||The Tornado also damaged the Blue-N-Hall Marina and Fishing Dock. In this area, a large boat hoist along with 18 boats and several boat trailers were damaged or destroyed. Several power poles were also snapped off and several vehicles were damaged. Numerous trees were also snapped off on Hird Island. The Tornado likely dissipated over Doboy Sound as a waterspout. Besides portions of the Gateway roof, lots of other debris including signs were deposited on Sapelo Island.","A warm front lifted northward through southern South Carolina and southeast Georgia during the morning, with a strong cold front then sweeping through the area during the evening.

The seasons first strong push of deep moisture moved into Iowa on the 25th with surface temperatures warming into the mid 80s and dew points surging into the upper 60s to low 70s.  Precipitable water values were near 1.5 inches.  The dry slot pushed north across the area the previous night as the warm front lifted north.  The primary surface low was located over northern Minnesota.  A cold front extended south from the low into northwest Iowa.  The airmass became very unstable by the mid afternoon hours.  MUCAPE rose to between 4000 and 5000 J/kg.  Lifted indices fell to -8 to -11 C.  There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.

Meteorologists walked through the area and spoke with numerous people affected, many of whom were eye witnesses to the event.||This tornado passed through the city of Dickinson on the far south side, mainly just south of the Heart River. No witnesses spoken to actually saw the tornado. From their eye witness accounts, and from video obtained by the Dickinson Police Department, it is likely that this was a rain-wrapped tornado, and very difficult if not impossible to see. The tornado occurred before sunset, yet it was described as being as dark as night during the event.||The conclusion of the damage survey was that this tornado touched down around a mile or so outside the city limits, on the southwest side, and moved east-northeast, passing through the far southern part of the city. It lifted back into the parent thunderstorm on the extreme southeast side of Dickinson near the city limit. This occurred in the window between 815 PM MDT and 830 PM MDT.||Over 450 structures were damaged, of which nearly 100 were declared completely destroyed or beyond repair. Numerous vehicles were damaged or destroyed, some were on their roofs. Power lines were snapped, knocking out power to most of Dickinson, and tree damage was extensive. Two minor injuries were reported, with no deaths. The injuries were to a 23 year old male and a 42 year old male. Both occurred in homes.||The worst damage surveyed was between the Heart River and roughly 8th Street Southwest and 8th Street Southeast in southern Dickinson. Of that damage, the absolute worst corresponded to middle EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Scale. From that it was determined that peak wind speeds in the tornado were on the order of 150 mph.||Other parts of Dickinson and the surrounding area sustained wind damage likely associated with the rear flank downdraft of the storm.","In the mid afternoon hours of Wednesday, July 8th, Tornado Watch 563 was issued for all of western and parts of central North Dakota, due to the expected widespread and dangerous development and rapid intensification of thunderstorms near a surface trough along the western North Dakota border. Destabilization along the surface trough, coupled with the approach of a strong upper level trough and an intensifying late afternoon/early evening low level jet, all contributed to the watch issuance. Later Wednesday evening, Severe Thunderstorm Watch 565 was issued for much of central North Dakota to replace the expiring Tornado Watch, and specifically to account for a developing bow echo which was expected to push east across the watch area into the early morning hours of Thursday, July 9th.||The end result was a large severe weather outbreak experienced across much of west and central North Dakota, lasting from the late afternoon hours of the 8th, into the early morning hours of the 9th.

The tornado was a large and occasionally multiple-vortex tornado as it moved northwest and north of Medford and was embedded within a larger scale circulation that was strong enough to produce damage along a wide area around the tornado path.  The tornado caused significant structural damage about 5 miles northwest of Medford and 5 miles east of Renfrow, and many areas of tree and power pole damage. This tornado moved into Kay County.","A significant outbreak of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes affected a large part of northern, central, and southern Oklahoma. Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas. |Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.||During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.||The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.||During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.||More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic. ||By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storm's fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted. ||While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million.

The residence suffered some shingle and antenna damage. The tornado then tracked northeast to a second farm where several outbuildings were damaged or destroyed along with widespread tree damage. The main residence at this location suffered no damage. Several grain cars were also rolled about 100 yards into the trees behind the house.||The large tornado continued to track northeast to a third farm to the north of Bowdle. The main residence suffered major damage to walls with part of the roof structure removed. Widespread tree damage was sustained with many of the |trees completely debarked with only the stumps of the largest branches |remaining. Two large garages were completely destroyed with the |concrete slab wiped clean. The vehicles in one garage were |rolled or tossed from 25 to 100 yards away.

This home and the garage/barn next to it sustained considerable damage,  leaving the home inhabitable.  The damage to the home consisted of all the walls collapsing, with all remaining debris from the house tossed to the northeast. The garage walls collapsed with the contents tossed to the east.  Two four-wheelers and a four-door automobile inside the garage were lifted and flipped over as the tornado passed.  Further north along Route 1, there was minor structural damage to a couple of homes and several trees uprooted.

The tornado reached a peak intensity of EF4 and was responsible for the deaths of seven people.  Five of the victims died immediately with the other two passing away from their injuries at later dates.  The initial touchdown occurred east of Perrysburg along Oregon Road just to the north of the Ohio Turnpike.  The tornado then moved east northeast toward Toledo Metcalf Field as an EF0 to EF1.  The tornado intensified to an EF2 as it crossed East Broadway Street.  Over two dozen homes in a neighborhood bordered by East Broadway to the west and State Route 795 to the north and east were heavily damaged or destroyed.  The worst of the damage was along Shawnee and Neill Avenues in this neighborhood.  The tornado then crossed State Route 795 and followed the highway toward Metcalf Field.  The tornado intensified to EF3 at that time.  Several homes along Moline-Martin Road were destroyed between State Route 795 and Metcalf Field.  An occupant of one of the homes, an 87 year old man, was injured by the tornado and later died.  As the tornado approached Metcalf Field it crossed a railroad yard and overturned a couple dozen railroad cars.  The tornado then moved across the southern end of the airport grounds and destroyed the Lake Township Administrative and Police Department building located just northwest of the intersection of Cummings Road and State Route 795.  A 20 year old female was killed by the tornado just outside of the police department.  She had left her vehicle along with her boyfriend and child to seek refuge in the police station.  She was caught outside and was reportedly killed by flying debris.  At the police station, the tornado destroyed at least six police vehicles and one emergency response vehicle. The emergency response vehicle was found over 1000 feet away from its original position. One police vehicle was found wrapped around a large tree. After doing extensive damage to an agricultural business, the tornado struck the Lake Local School District complex along State Route 795 and Lemoyne Road.  Lake High School took a direct hit from the tornado and was damaged enough to be considered destroyed.  The nearby middle and elementary schools sustained considerable roof damage.  The high school gymnasium was scheduled to hold a commencement ceremony for the graduating senior class on June 6th.  Large sections of the gymnasium collapsed.  A field house, cafeteria and auditorium adjacent to the high school were destroyed.  At least eight school buses were overturned and destroyed by the tornado.  The tornado continued to move parallel to and just north of State Route 795 at EF3 intensity.  A 56 year old female was killed by flying debris while driving her car on State Route 795 near the school complex.  The woman's daughters were following in another car which was also destroyed.  The daughters both sustained minor injuries.  The tornado continued east northeast and crossed Interstate 280 just north of the State Route 795 interchange before moving across open fields for about a mile.  The tornado may have briefly weakened to EF2 intensity, but then strengthened back to EF3 intensity as it crossed Bradner Road to the west of Millbury.  The tornado destroyed several homes in a neighborhood bordered by Bradner Road to the west and Cherry Street to the south.  A 47 year old man was killed in house on Case Road in this neighborhood.  The man's daughter was the valedictorian of the graduating senior class at Lake High School which was destroyed by the tornado.  The tornado then intensified to EF4 as it approached Main Street on the north side of Millbury.  Over a dozen homes were destroyed or heavily damaged along Main Street.  A 36 year old woman and her four year old son were killed in one of the destroyed homes on Main Street.  The woman's 37 year old husband died on June 12th from injuries sustained from the tornado.  Several more homes were destroyed or heavily damaged on Hille Drive and Woodville Road before the tornado crossed North Fostoria Road and moved into Ottawa County as a weak EF3 or strong EF2 tornado.   This tornado was on the ground for around six and a half miles in Wood County and destroyed or heavily damaged over 60 homes.  Dozens of additional homes sustained minor damage with another couple hundred homes affected by the storm.  Dozens of vehicles were also destroyed.  Hundreds of trees were toppled or snapped by the tornado along the damage path which was up to 400 yards in width.  The tornado debarked some of the larger trees along the damage path.  At least one high tension utility pole was toppled by the tornado and widespread power outages occurred in Millbury and Walbridge.   Damage to the Lake Township infrastructure was estimated at five million dollars with tens of millions of losses to the Lake Local School District. The exact number of injuries caused by this tornado is unknown, but at least 17 people had to be hospitalized in nearby Toledo.  Debris from this tornado has been found dozens of miles away, including on some of the islands in western Lake Erie.","A stationary frontal system stretched across the lower Great Lakes on the morning of Saturday, June 5th.

Accounting for the changes in direction of this track, the actual path length covered by the tornado was 19.95 miles.||Near 180th Street and County Road 2, a home was likely in the outer circulation of the tornado, as it sustained some roof and siding damage.  A barn was also destroyed to its brick foundation and a car was also flipped over lengthwise. Some evidence of tree debarking was noted.  The tornado continued to the northeast and caused extensive crop damage approximately 500 yards in width. Near County Roads 17 and 63, the tornado intensified to produce EF-3 damage, impacting a farmstead and causing the complete destruction of three swine barns and the loss of 12 head of swine. Two empty grain bins were completely blown away at this location. The house at this location had some roof damage but appeared to be northwest of the main tornado path. Approximately 100 feet northeast of the house, a 150 foot tripod style wind turbine tower was twisted and toppled. This location also marked the beginning of crops being completely raked, with only stalks of corn left, and soybean fields being almost unrecognizable.||After passing through this farmstead the tornado took a more easterly path across County Road 63, and maintained EF-3 strength. After passing County Road 63, another farmstead was hit, and two empty harvester silos were toppled.  The tornado continued to the northeast across County Road 4, where continued raking of the fields was noted with significant deposition of debris along the tornado path. Numerous trees were toppled at County Road 89 where it turns to the north. The tornado continued to the north-northeast, grew to 1000 yards, and around 1750 LST impacted a farmstead along County Road 12 two miles north of Conger, where EF-4 damage was observed. The house at this location was completely destroyed, as was the barn and several other buildings. Extensive tree damage was noted with nearly all branches being removed from the trunks.  Debarking of trees was widespread at this location. A car was also tumbled a distance of 3200 feet, coming to rest in a field east of County Road 12.||The tornado continued to the northeast across County Road 69 and County Road 46, where it weakened slightly to EF-3 intensity. As it crossed County Road 46, a house was rotated off the foundation. The tornado was approximately 700 yards wide at this point. To the north-northeast, a swine barn was destroyed with sheet metal being carried off to Interstate 90. At this same time, a satellite tornado developed and caused damage in the town of Armstrong (see separate entry).||The main tornado continued to the north-northeast and was 500 yards in width. The tornado crossed County Road 74 and caused EF-2 damage to three farmsteads. One farmstead with a manufactured home was hit, resulting in one fatality and one severe injury.  The tornado crossed Interstate 90 just west of County Road 14 as it grew to one third of a mile in width and re-strengthened to EF-3 intensity. Several farmsteads saw significant damage between Sugar Lake and County Road 14, with a house and two barns completely destroyed. From this point the tornado continued to the north, growing to one mile in width. Around 1800 LST, a house and barn were destroyed approximately one mile west of Manchester on County Road 25, where extensive tree and structural damage was also noted at several properties in the area. Additionally, west of this tornadic damage, a separate area of tree and structural damage was caused by strong thunderstorm winds associated with a rear flank downdraft (see separate entry).||About one mile north, the tornado weakened slightly to EF-2 Intensity, where it damaged three full grain bins near County Road 29. The tornado was approximately 1300 yards at this point.  Further north, at County Road 95, the tornado continued to weaken, although a farmstead still received EF-1 damage to trees and structures.  Finally, the tornado continued north and began to narrow and weaken. It dissipated west of Hartland. One person was killed and 14 injured from this tornado.","Several strong storms developed in west-central Minnesota during the mid afternoon hours of June 17th.  ||These storms quickly become severe and produced softball size hail northwest of Alexandria and a tornado near Leaf Valley that became the EF-4 that moved through Wadena, Minnesota.  ||By the late afternoon, numerous thunderstorms developed across southern Minnesota along the leading edge of extreme instability. ||Numerous funnel cloud reports and a few brief tornado touchdowns were noted prior to 5 pm, but once the low level shear (0-1 km) increased significantly from 15 knots, to over 35 knots, strong tornadoes developed along the Iowa border.| |These storms along the Iowa border produced a series of long-lived tornadoes near Albert Lea, Minnesota.

The supercell thunderstorm developed strong rotation, and rotating wall clouds and brief funnel clouds were reported in Daniels County.  As the storm moved southeast, it intensified and a large, long-lived tornado formed.  The tornado traveled for 18 miles, mostly through rural areas, but it had devastating impacts as it hit a ranch, killing two people and injuring one.   On the morning of July 27th, 2010 two teams of NWS Glasgow staff surveyed the damage area.  The first team started in Daniels County and followed the track of the storm to the east-southeast.   The second team met with county and state officials at the site of the ranch that was most devastated.   Both teams spoke to law enforcement officials, as well as weather spotters and the public who had reports of weather and/or damage as well as those who saw the tornado.   ||The initial damage from the tornado originated about 12 miles south of Redstone.   Along the Reserve and Wanso Roads, six miles of power lines were snapped off.  Sheridan Electric was able to restore power fairly quickly to the majority of residences by the next morning.  Due to the poles being snapped, the tornado was rated an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale in this area.   This was the widest portion of the tornado track with a width of a half mile.||The tornado continued east-southeast where it encountered an abandoned farmhouse, a barn and a bridge that went across Wolf Creek on the Three Corners Road.  The bridge had the planks ripped off with damage totals coming to $100,000.  The farmhouse was blown off of the foundation, had some of the siding stripped off, and roof damage.  The barn was completely destroyed, with the west and north facing walls blown away, and the south and east facing walls intact for the most part, but flattened on the ground.  Two grain bins were destroyed, with a third still on its foundation but crushed.  They appeared to be empty.   The damage at this location was rated an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  The width of the tornado at this point was a quarter mile wide. ||The storm continued on its east-southeast track at a speed of about 30 mph.  The Smith Ranch was then impacted.  The ranch sits on a bit of a hill with a small stream valley from the west-northwest to just north of the property.  There are no shelter belts or terrain to block some of the winds from the tornado.  The two fatalities and one injury occurred at the Smith Ranch.  The adult fatality was trying to get into the basement.  The child fatality was in the basement and the chimney collapsed and crushed him.  The adult injury was with the child, but on the other side of the chimney in the basement. ||The tornado was rated an EF3 at the Smith Ranch, with a width of three tenths of a mile.  This was the highest rating during the life cycle of the tornado.  Along with the devastating destruction of property, there was also up to 40 cows and calves significantly injured or killed by the tornado and/or debris.  Many had severe injuries and had to be put down by a veterinarian.  ||The damage totals are estimated.   ||A formal written report is available from the NWS Glasgow office.",An upper air disturbance moves east just north of a frontal boundary that helped to trigger severe weather.

The setup featured a 45 knot mid level flow and a 95 knot upper level jet.  Matter of fact, a larger area of showers, associated with a warm front, had moved across southeast Ohio and West Virginia during the morning and midday hours. This kept the surface based instability at a minimum.  However, new cells formed further west during the mid afternoon over western Ohio.  It was this new cluster of convection that would intensify due to the strong mid and upper level dynamics.  Several of the new cells formed and intensified on the southern or southwestern flank of the overall larger area of showers and thunderstorms.  This area of convection stretched further to the northeast into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  This allowed an unimpeded low level moisture inflow into the new development.

A small pocket of EF3 damage located along Route 68 in the valley and flood plain along the river.  The maximum wind gusts were estimated at 160 mph here.  Also, the width of the tornado briefly widened to 500 yards here.  Well built single family homes received major damage or were destroyed.  In this area, a 57 year old male was killed.  He, his wife, and their dog had gone downstairs into the basement for protection.  The husband went back upstair to get a flashlight.  He figured the electricity would go out, as darkness had already set in.  At that point, he disappeared as the tornado hit.  His wife tried to open the door to let him back down, but she could not open the door. Their ranch style home with a brick front was destroyed.  His body was found some 150 to 200 feet away in a field.  Ten other people were injured, but none seriously.  Other significant structural and tree damage occurred along a river access road and basically along the South Fork of Lee Creek drainage toward Rockport.  The total path length of this tornado from Meigs County Ohio into Wood County was over 9 miles.   All total, the county reported 10 homes destroyed, 6 homes with major damage, and 27 homes with minor damage.  About 15 to 18 outbuildings were damaged or destroyed.","A cold front, in tandem with strong mid and upper level forcing, produced a severe weather outbreak in southeast Ohio into extreme western West Virginia during the late afternoon and evening of Thursday the 16th. The setup featured a 45 knot mid level flow and a 95 knot upper level jet.  Matter of fact, a larger area of showers, associated with a warm front, had moved across southeast Ohio and West Virginia during the morning and midday hours. This kept the surface based instability at a minimum.  However, new cells formed further west during the mid afternoon over western Ohio.  It was this new cluster of convection that would intensify due to the strong mid and upper level dynamics.  Several of the new cells formed and intensified on the southern or southwestern flank of the overall larger area of showers and thunderstorms.  This area of convection stretched further to the northeast into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  This allowed an unimpeded low level moisture inflow into the new development.  Surface dew points ahead of the cold front reached into the mid 60s.||Most of the severe thunderstorms exhibited strong rotation, resulting in the spawning of 5 tornadoes.  Four of these 5 tornadoes were in southeast Ohio.  One of the 4 Ohio tornadoes crossed from Fairfield County into western Perry County.   Another 1 of the 4 crossed from Perry into northwestern Morgan County.  One tornado patch was solely in Athens County.  Finally, the last of the 4 tornadoes in Ohio crossed the Ohio River from northeastern Meigs County into southern Wood County in West Virginia.  This tornado was the strongest and resulted in a fatality on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River.  The last direct death from a tornado in West Virginnia was back in June of 1982.  Finally, the last short tornado path in this outbreak was solely in western West Virginia, located in Wirt County.",470,,,

A frame home was pushed off its foundation and a number of frame homes suffered moderate to major roof damage. Numerous power poles were snapped along the path. The widest point of the damage path was around a quarter mile, and was near Highway 14 in Attala County. Maximum winds were around 140 mph. Total path length across Leake and Attala Counties was 10 miles.","During the evening hours of November 29th and the overnight/early morning period of the 30th, the region was impacted by an outbreak of tornadoes. This outbreak brought 13 tornadoes to the forecast area. This occurred as potent storm system moved out of the Rockies and developed a strong area of low pressure across the Central Plains. This surface low caused a warm front to take shape and quickly lift northward across the forecast during the afternoon of the 29th. Warm and humid conditions pushed north, which led to unstable conditions over the region just ahead of the advancing strong cold front. The wind energy through the atmosphere was strong. The resulting wind shear (change in wind speed or direction with height) was strong and very favorable for rotating storms and supporting tornadoes. As the clash of systems occurred, a mix of supercell thunderstorms developed, along with a broken line of thunderstorms. A handful of these storms utilized the strong wind shear present and produced tornadoes. Overall, 13 tornadoes occurred with 5 being of the strong variety (EF2-EF3). The strongest tornado occurred over northwest Leake and southern Attala Counties. Here, an EF3 moved along a 10 mile path and destroyed numerous mobile homes, 6 people were injured. Four other strong tornadoes occurred and were all rated EF2. Two of these occurred in Yazoo County, one just southwest of Yazoo City and the other in Downtown Yazoo City. Numerous buildings were damaged along with many trees and power lines down. Another EF2 occurred in Starkville where it destroyed multiple mobile homes in town. Fifteen injuries occurred in this area. The final EF2 occurred in Smith County. This tornado had an 11 mile path which started just SW of Raleigh to 6 miles NE of Raleigh. One brick home sustained significant damage along with numerous other buildings and sheds damaged.||This outbreak broke a streak of 3 years when no tornadoes occurred during the month of November across Mississippi. Additionally, the last Fall outbreak of tornadoes occurred on November 24, 2004. Historically, November marks the peak of our 2nd severe weather season and ranks 3rd as the most active month for tornadoes in Mississippi, just a few behind March.",474,,,
